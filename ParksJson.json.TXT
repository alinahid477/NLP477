				"why_you_should_visit":"\n\t\t<p>Abercrombie Karst Conservation Reserve is a special place, here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Caves of time</b><br>\nAbercrombie Caves and the surrounding area is part of the traditional country of the Burra Burra group, who are part of the larger Wiradjuri tribe. The Burra Burra group knew about the caves, although no Aboriginal artifacts have been found in Arch Cave itself.  However, in 1977 a research team found stone tools and animal bones, inlcuding some from extinct animals, in a shelter north of the Great Arch.</p>\n<p><b>Underground wonders</b><br>\nAs early as 1821, the Sydney Gazette reported that 'a cave of considerable dimensions has been recently discovered in the neighbourhood of Bathurst'.  There’s no wonder that almost 200 years later the caves attract visitors from far and wide. The famous Arch Cave is 221 metres long, 60 metres wide at both ends and 30 metres high in the middle. It’s considered the largest cave of its type in the southern hemisphere. Join a <a title=\"cave tour\" href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkTours.aspx?id=N0350\" target=\"_blank\">cave tour</a> and discover the incredible natural world underground.</p>\n<p><b>Gold rush history</b><br>\nThe caves also have a fascinating manmade history. In the early 1830s, a group of bushrangers known as 'The Ribbon Gang' were using the Arch as a hideout. Throughout the 1830s, people from the nearby properties started to visit the main cave and by the 1840s it was a popular spot. But the discovery of nearby gold in the 1850s resulted in a huge increase in visitors. For relaxation, miners would come to the caves on a Saturday evening to drink and dance the night away. There is even a time capsule embedded into the walls, which they will reopen in 2079.</p>"

Kangaroos, wallabies and emus are seen throughout the park, and echidnas and wombats live on the slopes and river flats. The rivers and creeks are home to eastern water dragons and the shy platypus, as well as many species of fish. Most of them are protected, although you can fish for introduced trout. In summer, you’ll hear the sound of frogs calling out near the creeks. There are also more than 60 species of birds around here – look for wedge-tail eagles soaring above Abercrombie fire trail.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal history</b><br>\nThe ridgelines and rivers running through Abercrombie River National Park were once traditional travel and trading routes for the Wiradjuri and Gundungarra people. Evidence of open campsites can be found along the rivers and creeks in the park.</p>\n<p><b>Gold standard</b><br>\nLandscapes of deep gullies with rivers running through them – such as the one found at Abercrombie River – provide ideal conditions for loose gold. During the gold rush of the second half of the 1800s, the precious mineral was discovered here. Following the rivers and creeks you can find evidence – sluices and diggings – still there today.</p>\n<p><b>Action-ready</b><br>\nThis is an environment built for adventure. One of the most popular activities in the park is 4WD touring. Some of the trails running along gorges and ridges can be pretty challenging, even for the experienced driver. For those with plenty of energy, you can also explore these trails on a mountain bike. The rivers and creeks, shaded by tall casuarinas, have plenty of deep waterholes. Pull on your swimmers and jump on in. Or perhaps you’ve got a canoe or kayak – bring it along because there are some good stretches for paddling.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001005","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Oberon</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6336 1972<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 38 Ross Street, Oberon NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9.00am - 4.30pm, Monday to Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Abercrombie River National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oberon (40km)</li>\n<li>Goulburn (60km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (120km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Goulburn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The main access to the park is via the Arkstone Road.

It was also used as an internment camp in World War I and today the ruins continue to intrigue visitors. It’ll take you about an hour to wander through the gaol and the museum. The region has high cultural and spiritual significance to the local Dhungatti people.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatchers welcome<br></b>Arakoon National Park features a landscape of eucalypt forests, heathlands, wetlands and rocky outcrops that are home to a large range of birds. You’ll find black swans and herons in the park’s wetland areas, and in the heathland’s casuarina and banksia you might see honeyeaters, quails and fantails. When you’re out fishing or exploring the park’s coastline, keep your eyes open for ospreys, eagles and falcons soaring high in the sky, or foraging for food along the beach. In spring, look for glossy black cockatoos feeding on she-oak seeds.</p>\n<p><b>Walk through time<br></b>There are several interesting walking tracks within the park that take you on a journey through landscapes and time. The Bridle trail, accessible from Little Bay or the park entrance, follows the original trails used during the gaol’s construction and today offers a short but spectacular rainforest and eucalypt walk. The Monument Hill track takes you past a monument to the Germans interned in the prison.</p>\n<p><b>Ideal family getaway</b><br>\nArakoon National Park is in a magnificent natural setting with a spectacular coastline. There are coastal walks with wonderful views and places to picnic and excellent beachside camping and cottage accommodation. If you’re looking for a place to swim and snorkel, head to sheltered Trial Bay and the kiosk is nearby if you’re looking for a relaxed lunch or dinner. The picnic area at Little Bay is popular with young families, offering barbecues and a large grassed area for games.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001069","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>South West Rocks (Trial Bay Gaol)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6566 6168<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Arakoon National Park, Cardwell Street, South West Rocks NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:30pm, daily (closed Christmas Day).

The Bundjalung of Byron Bay (Arakwal) Peoples' connection to the reserve was recognised in 2001, with the signing of an Indigenous Land Use Agreement between the Bundjalung of Byron Bay (Arakwal) People and the NSW State Government.</p>\n<p><b>Preserving plants<br></b>Arakwal may be small from the outside, but its borders hold some important habitat for threatened plant species like the creatively-named stinking crypotocarya, and dark greenhood. Keen nature enthusiasts will find much of interest – bring the magnifying glass, but be careful not to damage what you see.</p>\n<p><b>Animals on the move<br></b>The reserve is also a temporary home to a range of nomadic and migratory animals, which means it’s never quite the same in any given season. During autumn and winter, for example, the growing, flowering and fruiting season attracts birds, flying foxes and micro bats.

Collections of granite archways, scattered boulders, ravines roping their way through the terrain and a pile of enormous smooth granite stones balancing strangely across each other, all await your exploration. The boulders, looming in and out of view as you make your ascent towards the crown, bear the majestic title of ‘Granite Titans’, and it’s easy to see why. Bald Rock’s water-streaked dome is the largest granite formation of its kind anywhere in Australia.</p>\n<p><b>A peaceful trade<br></b>Bald Rock also served as neutral ground for three of the Aboriginal nations of the area: the Jukambal, Bundgalung and Kamilleroi. An important trade route for these three nations, meetings and trade occurred without each nation having to journey through the other territories, as Bald Rock was considered a boundary positioned fairly between each Country.</p>\n<p><b>A picture to remember<br></b>From the summit, the best views are seen across winter and autumn, when the air is freshest and the light crisp. The colours are most dramatic at dusk, as the rock face hues change beneath your feet from orange to yellow. Be sure to take your camera, a flask of coffee, and wait till the sun sets to capture a photograph worthy of your living room wall.</p>\n<p><b>Nature lovers<br></b>Following a good rain, the smells and colours of the bush really come alive; golden wattle trees bloom late in July as do wildflowers across spring, and the vibrant colours of the rock lilies, boronia and banksia are a sight to behold. Look out for the rare spotted tailed quoll, as well as possums, grey kangaroos and swamp wallabies on your tour through the park.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001254","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tenterfield</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6736 4298<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 10 Miles Street, Tenterfield NSW 2372<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Bald Rock National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Tenterfield (25km)</li>\n<li>Stanthorpe (74km)</li>\n<li>Warwick (135km)</li>\n<li>Lismore (180km)</li>\n<li>Armidale (210km)</li>\n<li>Toowoomba (216km)</li>\n<li>Brisbane (290km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Tenterfield:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Take the Mount Lindesay Road for 25km along a sealed road</li>\n<li>Turn into the Bald Rock Access Road (also sealed) for 5km before reaching the Bald Rock picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Bald Rock National Park is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Bald Rock National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Rich Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>Bangadilly National Park lies at the heart of the territory of the Gundungurra Aboriginal people, whose traditional land extends all the way from Lithgow to Goulburn. Other groups with associations to the area are the Dharug to the north, Dharawal to the east and Wiradjuri to the west. The Wingecarribee River valley, with its permanent water source and diverse plant and animal resources, is likely to have been important to all of these tribes as both a living area and travel route. The junction of the Wingecarribee and Wollondilly rivers, just downstream from the park, is also known to be of great significance in Aboriginal mythology.</p>\n<p><b>See the forest for the trees<br></b>One of the best things about visiting Bangadilly is the chance to stroll through its impressive and varied vegetation, which includes open forest and woodlands on the dry ridges and slopes of the park and majestic forests nestling in the sheltered valleys and all along the riverbanks. The park’s unique and striking plant life made up of two distinct types, Sydney Basin and Tablelands, each with its own quite unique beauty.</p>\n<p><b>Spot rare, threatened species<br></b>There are many unusual species to be spotted in the park, including several species of “arboreal mammals” or, more simply put, mammals that live in trees, such as koalas, squirrels and greater gliders. Keep your eyes out for platypus down along the riverbanks and look up high to spot interesting birds and bats, such as Peregrine falcons, glossy black cockatoos, spotted-tailed quolls, and large-eared pied bats.</p>\n<p><b>Geological wonders<br></b>The park’s distinctive geology consists of three sections of plateau country bounded by steep escarpments and rocky gullies that drop dramatically into valleys along Wingecarribee River. Mount Penang and other rocky outcrops on the ends of the ridges provide spectacular views of Wingecarribee River valley.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001060","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4887 7270<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Morton National Park, Nowra Road, Fitzroy Falls NSW 2577<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Bangadilly National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bowral (20km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney or Goulburn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exit the freeway at Sutton Forest (exit signposted as 'Illawarra Highway - Moss Vale, Wollongong').

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b><br>\nBarren Grounds Nature Reserve holds a very special place in the history of conservation in NSW, as it was the third faunal reserve to be gazetted under the Fauna Protection Act. Led by early conservation leaders like Myles Dunphy, Paddy Pallin and Allen Strom, it was protected in 1956. Since then, it has been an important place for researchers and students alike to record and learn about the incredible biodiversity of this area. The stone building at Barren Grounds picnic area – once known as The Lodge - was used for accommodation by researchers and honorary rangers.</p>\n<p><b>Diverse plant life<br></b>Thanks to conservation efforts in the 1950s, Barren Grounds Nature Reserve remains a place rich in biodiversity and home to many unique plant species. It’s famous for its heath wildflowers in spring and summer, which bring the reserve to life and colour, and flowering banksias in winter. The heathland is also one of only four large areas of heath on the NSW South Coast, making it an important habitat for many species of plants and animals. A large number of threatened or regionally rare ferns and other species also occur in wet sheltered sites below the escarpment, including several species of filmy fern.</p>\n<p><b>Birds, birds and more birds</b><br>\nWith around 180 bird species found here, you can easily understand why Barren Grounds Nature Reserve is paradise for birdwatchers. On the heath, you're likely to come across honeyeaters and southern emu wrens. In the forest areas, lyrebirds, crimson rosellas, cockatoos and grey currawongs are commonly seen. And if you're really lucky, you might even spot the bright green ground parrot or an eastern bristlebird while walking on the heath. In fact, it was to protect these two threatened heathland birds that Barren Grounds Nature Reserve was set up in 1956.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001060","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4887 7270<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Morton National Park, Nowra Road, Fitzroy Falls NSW 2577<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Barren Grounds Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jamberoo (10km)</li>\n<li>Robertson (16km)</li>\n<li>Kiama (20km)</li>\n<li>Moss Vale (38km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (40km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (122km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Moss Vale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Illawarra Highway east towards Robertson</li>\n<li>Just after Robertson, turn right onto Jamberoo Mountain Road.</li>\n<li>Continue until you reach the signposted entrance on your right</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Kiama:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Jamberoo Road heading west to Jamberoo</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Jamberoo Mountain Road and follow it to the top of the escarpment</li>\n<li>The reserve entrance is signposted on your left</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Barren Grounds Nature Reserve is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Bicycles are not permitted on management or walking trails in this reserve.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Barren Grounds Nature Reserve.

On the Pambula River Walk you can see ancient Aboriginal sites – one midden has been proven to be over 3,000 years old. At Twofold Bay, the Yuin people had a special relationship with the killer whales. The killer whales drove humpback whales into shore, the people used spears to kill them and killer whales and people shared the meat. The Aboriginal people later taught European settlers to work with the killer whales in the shore based whaling days of Twofold Bay. Find out more about this fascinating history at Davidson Whaling Station Historic Site.</p>\n<p><b>Fascinating coastal heritage</b><br>\nThe first shore-based whaling station on mainland Australia was set up at Twofold Bay in 1828. Benjamin Boyd established a competing business and built a private lighthouse, Boyd’s Tower, and a township, Boydtown, before being declared bankrupt. The coast was the site of many shipwrecks. The Green Cape Lighthouse commenced operation in 1883 but shipwrecks continued, including the <i>Ly-ee-moon</i> that sank in 1886. You can pay your respects to some of the 76 victims at a graveyard a short walk from the lighthouse. There are also regular <a title=\"guided tours\" href=\"http://www.wildwildworld.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">guided tours</a> of the lighthouse.</p>\n<p><b>Meet the locals</b><br>\nSeveral threatened species take refuge here. North of Pambula River there’s an important population of yellow-bellied gliders – listen carefully for their trademark crackles and shrieks. This area is also great for birdwatching. Along the coast look out for seabirds, especially the beautiful white bellied sea eagles.</p>\n<p><b>Rugged flora</b><br>\nThe park’s vegetation reflects its location in the driest, windiest part of the state’s coastline. You’ll see stretches of coastal heath beside sea cliffs and scrub shaped by salty air. There are also patches of tall coastal forest and wet forest gullies.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001061","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Merimbula</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6495 5000<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:FSCR@environment.nsw.gov.au\">FSCR@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Corner Sapphire Coast and Merimbula Drives, Merimbula NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday and some weekends during peak holiday periods</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Ben Boyd National is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pambula (1km)</li>\n<li>Eden (8km)</li>\n<li>Merimbula (10km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>The park is accessed from the Princes Highway.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Run, walk or ride<br></b>Bushwalking, running, cycling and horse riding are popular activities for Dubbo residents and visitors alike. Ride along one of the many criss-crossing trails – you’ll find 45km of double track – but don’t forget that these are shared with walkers and vehicles. If you’re serious about cycling, why not join the annual Beni Spring Spin, held right here in the park? And if you’re not sure which trails to explore on your visit, grab a brochure from the park office or information bay.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>Beni State Conservation Area contains a number of creek lines once used by local Aboriginal groups for water, food and shelter. To see evidence of this, make a beeline for one of the area’s sandy creeks or gullies. There, you can see some small artefacts and grinding grooves – indentations made by Aboriginal people sharpening their axes and tools on the sandstone.</p>\n<p><b>Plentiful plant life<br></b>This is a great place to bask in majestic Australian bushland and remnant native forest. Abundant cypress and ironbark woodland give you a typical taste of central west NSW, but you’ll also find some small patches of the white box, yellow box and Blakely’s red gum woodland endangered ecological community. There are wattle trees abound, along with a myriad of shrubs, which transform into a riot of wildflowers in spring. Look carefully where you walk too – you may be about to step on a delicate ground orchid.</p>\n<p><b>A thriving habitat<br></b>Beni State Conservation Area is an important habitat for a number of threatened woodland birds, including the brown treecreeper, speckled warbler and varied sittella. Look out for the red-capped robin and eastern ringneck during the day, and in the evening you might hear the hoot of boobooks owls, tawny frogmouths and the threatened barking owl. It’s possible you’ll see an echidna, swamp wallaby or wallaroo, along with a variety of lizards, frogs and the odd goanna, too.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001184","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Dubbo</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6841 7100<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Lot 5/74 River Street, Dubbo NSW 2830<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Beni State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firgrove Estate (3km)</li>\n<li>Wongarbon (5km)</li>\n<li>Dubbo (10km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Dubbo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow Myall Street east through town</li>\n<li>Continue along Myall Street, which then turns into Whitewood Road.</li>\n<li>Follow Whitewood Road to the end, where you’ll find the entrance to Beni State Conservation Area.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a> </p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Beni State Conservation Area.

Also known as Gulguer (meaning whirlpool or spinning), Bents Basin is associated with an awful aquatic creature called Gurungadge or Gurungaty. This creature is prominent in the area’s ancestral stories. Archaeological finds suggest the area was also an important trading place. Bents Basin and the adjoining Gulguer Nature Reserve protect a variety of Aboriginal rock art and artefacts.</p>\n<p><b>Rare communities</b><br>\nA visit to the park allows you to see majestic Camden white gums in one of only two known naturally-occurring populations. Look out also for Cumberland Plain woodland which once blanketed almost 30% of the Sydney Basin. Today, its scattered fragments cover less than 6% and remain under threat.</p>\n<p><b>Bygone days</b><br>\nExplorer and botanist George Caley was the first European to visit the area in 1802 and afterwards collected plant specimens for preservation. The area was later used as a stopping point for early settlers travelling from the developing east. If you’re interested in the local history of western Sydney, be sure to check out the historic inn, established in the 1860's and listed on both the state and National Heritage Register, you'll find it near Peppercorn picnic area.</p>\n<p><b>Fascinating and fun</b><br>\nThe basin itself is what draws most people here. Known as a scour pool, this geological formation is like a small lake, created over time by fast-flowing floodwaters exiting the gorge about 30-40km/hr. At 22m deep, its waters travel 150km before reaching the ocean. In addition to that, it’s heaps of fun to visit for a spot for swimming, fishing, paddling and liloing.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001129","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nattai Area office</h3>\n    <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4774 6800<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bents.basin@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bents.basin@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Wolstenholme Avenue Greendale NSW 2745<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Bents Basin State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wallacia (8km)</li>\n<li>Penrith (25km)</li>\n<li>Campbelltown (30km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (60km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Wallacia (north entry):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive southwest on Mulgoa Road/Tourist Drive 18</li>\n<li>At the Wallacia roundabout, take the second exit to Silverdale Road</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Bents Basin Road and follow signs for Bents Basin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Wallacia (south/east entry):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive southwest on Mulgoa Road/Tourist Drive 18</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Greendale Road</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Wolstenholme Avenue and follow signs for Bents Basin campground</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>Bents Basin State Conservation Area is a great place to visit all year round.

It contains a number of significant Aboriginal heritage sites, including artefacts, middens and campfire sites. This special area, with its land and waterways, plants and animals, features in all facets of Aboriginal culture and continues to be of great significance to Aboriginal people today.</p>\n<p><b>Bush in the ’burbs</b><br>\nEucalypt forests, delightful birdlife and all manner of creatures occupy this very beautiful bush valley stretching from the suburbs out towards the Hawkesbury river. Load up your pack with sandwiches and hats and take the family for a wander along the trails or laze under a tree at Crosslands Reserve while the kids play.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b> <br>\nThe deep gorges, cascading waterfalls and lush forests of Bindarri National Park are the traditional lands of the Gumbaynggirr people. The park is named after the Gumbaynggirr word ‘Bindarray’, which means ‘many creeks’. Many Aboriginal sites have been identified as places used by local Aboriginal people for camping, tool-making, ceremonies and dreaming stories.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b> <br>\nWalking out to Bangalore Falls, you might notice the large stumps standing as reminders of the parks former days of logging. Known as the ‘cedar getters’, the first Europeans arrived in this region in the mid-1800s. However, logging did not start until 1863. By 1880, concerns that Orara Valley would be cleared called for the declaration of Forest Reserve No 642, which later became Orara West State Forest in 1917.</p>\n<p><b>A ‘biodiversity hotspot’</b> <br>\nBindarri National Park is considered a ‘biodiversity hotspot’ due to the number of rare and threatened species found here, such as the palm orchid, fish bone fern and southern quassia. The park also provides an important corridor of native vegetation linking the hinterland and plateau habitats of the World Heritage-listed <a title=\"Dorrigo National Park\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/dorrigo-national-park\" target=\"_self\">Dorrigo National Park</a> with the coastal habitats of <a title=\"Bongil Bongil National Park\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/bongil-bongil-national-park\" target=\"_self\">Bongil Bongil National Park</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Abundant wildlife </b> <br>\nBindarri National Park is home to a range of wildlife including an abundance of bird species, wallabies, possums and the inquisitive spotted-tailed quoll. There are also many threatened species such as koalas, platypus, owls and bats. As you explore and swim in Urumbilum River, keep your eyes open for the brown-speckled giant barred frog.

You will see evidence of the park’s mining history in its unusual topography – undulations and scars are still a feature of the landscape. There is so much to discover about the park’s mining history, start by walking the easy Heritage Track which features an historic 1870's chimney, one of the few in good condition in NSW. This park is a fascinating work-in-progress, undergoing rejuvenation and transformation into the beautiful bushland setting much of the park already enjoys.</p>\n<p><b>Stacks to do</b> <br>\nThe local community has already discovered just how much there is to do at Blue Gum Hills Regional Park, and everyone’s welcome. You can make the most of the wide open spaces, pretty bushland setting and picnic and barbecue facilities, to spend the day bushwalking, cycling, orienteering, picnicking, horse-riding, playing ball games or simply reconnecting with the bush.</p>\n<p><b>The kids will love it too</b><br>\nFor the kids there’s a maze, a cool mine-themed playground, easy bush tracks for biking and burning off energy and the flying foxes and rope challenges of the TreeTop Adventure Park. And while they’re getting back to nature, see if they can spot the yellow tailed black cockatoo, with its huge, bulbous bill and bright yellow ear feathers and tail panel, and the masked owl, 50cm long, with a flat, heart-shaped face encircled by a dark border.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20100826115654773","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Newcastle</h3>\n        <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4946 4100</p>\n        \n        <p><strong>Street address:</strong> Hunter Wetland Centre, Sandgate Road, Shortland NSW</p>\n        <p><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am to 4:30pm</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Blue Gum National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minmi (0.5km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (14km)</li>\n<li>Gosford (75km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (140km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Newcastle, travel towards Wallsend and follow Minmi Road to Minmi village.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ancient connections</b><br>\nBlue Mountains National Park is part of the traditional land of the Gundungurra, Daruk and Wiradjuri people, who have been here since time began, living off the sea and the land. The Aboriginal sites in Blue Mountains National Park are important to Aboriginal people today; they are the physical evidence of a link to their ancestors. As you walk through this area, take some time to think about Aboriginal people and their strong attachment to this ancient landscape and all it contains. Some sites within the park, such as Red Hands Cave, are marked and other sites are not, so please take care when you’re exploring the park.</p>\n<p><b>Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area</b><br>\nIt is truly amazing to think that a city the size of Sydney has the extraordinary one million hectare Blue Mountains just a couple of hours away. It is part of a World Heritage - listed area of amazing values - geographic, botanic and cultural with six Aboriginal groups having connection to the country of the area. The forests of the <a title=\"Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area\" href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/protectedareas/GreaterBlueMountainsWorldHeritageArea.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area</a> have been described as a natural laboratory for the evolution of eucalypts; more than 90 different eucalypt species are found here – some 13 per cent of all eucalypt species in the world. They grow in a great variety of communities, from tall closed forests, through open forests and woodlands, to the stunted mallee shrublands on the plateaus. Try the overnight hike to Blue Gum Forest where you can camp beneath the stately tall trees with their smooth white-blue-grey bark.</p>\n<p><b>A walker’s paradise</b><br>\nThe Blue Mountains boasts one of the most complex track systems of any national park in Australia. Dating from as early as 1825, many of the constructed tracks have national, state and regional significance and several are named to commemorate significant periods or events in Australia’s history. The National Pass is one of the Blue Mountains’ iconic walking tracks. Constructed in 1906-1907, the track was built with shovels, crowbars and dynamite. In 2002 the track underwent major restoration works that included helicopters depositing sandstone blocks along the trail and heritage stonemasons perching on cliff faces to set sandstone ‘inserts’ into steps eroded over the years by weather and walkers. It’s an inspiring walk, with fantastic views of the Jamison Valley and beautiful waterfalls at either end.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Show caves","id":"{C58C2DB9-8AC5-475D-84AD-4CB9F6B411DD}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001004","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Blue Mountains (Blackheath)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4787 8877<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Govetts Leap Road, Blackheath NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9am - 4.30pm, seven days (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001003","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Blue Mountains (Glenbrook)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4739 2950 (Infoline only)<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Blue Mountains National Park, Bruce Road, Glenbrook NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Entry station is open weekends, public holidays and school holidays only</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001077","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Richmond</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4588 2400<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Bowmans Cottage, 370 Windsor Street, Richmond NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8.30am - 4.30pm, Monday to Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001005","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Oberon</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6336 1972<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 38 Ross Street, Oberon NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9.00am - 4.30pm, Monday to Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Blue Mountains National Park (Katoomba) is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lithgow (35km)</li>\n<li>Penrith (50km)</li>\n<li>Oberon (54km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (50km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the City West Link to Parramatta Road and veer right onto the Western Motorway</li>\n<li>Travel along the Western Motorway for about 45km</li>\n<li>Continue along the Great Western Highway and look for signs to Blue Mountains National Park</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Blue Mountains National Park is accessible from a number of stations, including Blackheath, Glenbrook, Katoomba, Leura, Mount Victoria and Wentworth Falls.

The shade and abundant water and fish this unique place offered provided a welcoming environment for its dwellers, and it’s full of stories of the past.</p>\n<p><br><b>Precious resources<br></b>The water was important to European settlers as well as Aboriginal people. In 1938, a weir was built on Bomaderry Creek to provide the first reliable water supply for the town of Bomaderry. When the weir waters were no longer needed for town water, a section of the weir was taken out to allow Australian bass and other fish free movement along the creek in a “fishway”. You can see the weir from the lookout near the picnic area.</p>\n<p><b>Rare plants<br></b>A walk through this lovely park in spring will reward you with the sight of an array of beautiful wildflowers. You’ll find this small park surprisingly rich with threatened plant species. These include the endangered Guinea flower, the vulnerable albatross mallee and bauer’s midge orchid. But perhaps the most unique plant that calls this park home is the endangered Bomaderry zieria – it only grows within the park and surrounding bushland and nowhere else in the world.</p>\n<p><b>Wild with activity<br></b>The park is alive with animal activity, day and night. Australian bass and other fish use the fishway in the weir to travel upstream. Threatened species such as the glossy black cockatoo, masked owl and yellow-bellied glider move among the trees and when darkness falls, small bats catch insects over the creek.</p>\n<p><strong>A gorge of rainforest and sandstone<br></strong>Bomaderry Creek has forged in the landscape a winding, cliff-lined gorge with sandstone outcrops and great slabs of fallen rock. The gorge not only looks dramatic, but also protects a diverse and beautiful environment, making it a wonderful spot to visit.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001190","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nowra</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4423 2170<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 55 Graham Street, Nowra NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"","car":"\n<p>From Wollongong and the north:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head south down the Princes Highway until you reach Bomaderry</li>\n<li>Turn right at the second roundabout (Narang Road)</li>\n<li>The park entrance is 300m along Narang Road on your left</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Nowra and the south:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn left at Narang Road and travel for 300m to the park entrance on the left</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Bomaderry Creek Regional Park.

It lies between the villages of Sawtell and Mylestom around 10km south of Coffs Harbour. The park stretches inland to, and beyond, the Pacific Highway at Pine Creek. It makes a great daytrip from Coffs Harbour or Nambucca Heads, or a place to stop for a picnic if you’re travelling along the north coast.</p>\n","fees":"","opening_times":"Bongil Bongil National Park is open sunrise to sunset but may have to close at times due to poor weather or fire danger.","safety_and_supplies_information":"","why_you_should_visit":"\n\t\t<p>Here are just some of the attractions you can enjoy at Bongil Bongil National Park:</p>\n<p><b>A place where one stays a long time</b><br>\nBongil Bongil National Park is the traditional land of the Gumbaynggir people, whose ancestral lands extend from Grafton in the north to the Nambucca river in the south, and from the coast west to the headwaters of the Nymboida river. The park provided abundant seafood and bushtucker, and was a site for gatherings and sacred ceremonies.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatcher’s haven</b><br>\nIn addition to being home to one of NSW’s largest koala popuations, Bongil Bongil National Park also boasts more than 165 species of birds. The park provides breeding, roosting and feeding habitats for a number of migratory birds like the little tern and the pied oystercatcher. The Bundagaree Rainforest walk is the best place to see the birds of the rainforest, like the dramatically beautiful wompoo fruit dove and the colourful rose-crowned fruit dove that makes a loud and explosive ‘hookco’ sound.</p>\n<p><b>Beaches and waterways</b><br>\nThe waterways within Bongil Bongil National Park carry water across the coastal plains from the steep foothills to the west, providing a home for many types of birds, animals and reptiles. For visitors, the waterways and beaches in Bongil Bongil National Park offer a range of water activities, including excellent fishing and kayaking. Try your luck on the Bonville river for flathead and whiting.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001039","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coffs Harbour</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6652 0900<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 32 Marina Drive, Coffs Harbour NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Bongil Bongil National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (10km)</li>\n<li>Urunga (10km)</li>\n<li>Nambucca Heads (35km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Coffs Harbour and Urunga:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Reptom / Mylestom exit from the new Pacific Highway</li>\n<li>Take Perry's Hill Road from the old Pacific Highway</li>\n<li>Perry's Hill Road becomes Tuckers Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Sawtell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Boronia Street to access Sawtell headland</li>\n<li>Take Lyons Road for Bonville Estuary and Bongil picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Bongil Bongil National Park.

If you’d like to see what this feature is really made of, then visit during the wetter months of summer. Even if the falls aren’t pumping, though, they’re still beautiful and there will always be rock pools along the river to swim in, walking tracks to follow and riverside picnics to indulge in.</p>\n<p><b>Gold fever</b><br>\nMorgans Gully and Ropers Gully are two sites in the park where alluvial gold was discovered in the late nineteenth century. As a result, there was a huge influx of European and Asian prospectors to the area. As well as giving the nearby town of Tenterfield a massive economic boost at the time, the village of Boonoo Boonoo temporarily flourished but is now ruins. Though nature has reclaimed these gullies too, imagine what the areas might have looked, sounded and smelt like when they were teeming with men from here and all over the world, half-crazy with gold fever.</p>\n<p><b>Have you seen the wildlife?</b><br>\nBoonoo Boonoo is an Aboriginal name meaning ‘poor country with no animals to provide food’. Since that name came about, before European settlement, the environment has significantly changed. Now kangaroos and wallabies visit the Cypress-pine campground and the park’s picnic areas at dawn and dusk. The wariest wallaby of them all, the threatened brush-tailed rock wallaby, can even be seen if you’re very quiet and patient. Spotted-tailed quolls, also a threatened species, sometimes visit the Cypress-pine campground at night and platypuses live and frolic in Boonoo Boonoo River.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001254","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tenterfield</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6736 4298<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 10 Miles Street, Tenterfield NSW 2372<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Boonoo Boonoo National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tenterfield (24km)</li>\n<li>Stanthorpe (79km)</li>\n<li>Glen Innes (122km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Tenterfield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the sealed Mount Lindesay (Woodenbong) Road for about 24km</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Boonoo Boonoo Falls Road and follow this unsealed road for 4km to the park entrance</li>\n<li>Travel for a further 9km to Boonoo Boonoo picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Stanthorpe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Amosfield Road and follow the signs to Bald Rock National Park along unsealed roads</li>\n<li>At the bitumen, travel past the turnoff to Bald Rock National Park and continue for 5km, then follow signs to Boonoo Boonoo National Park.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in<b> </b>Boonoo Boonoo National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Hundreds of years of Aboriginal history</b><br>\nThe traditional Aboriginal custodians of the reserve and surrounding area are the Birpai people, who once used the rainforests for a variety of important cultural purposes, such as gathering plants and animals for food and medicine. The origin of the name ‘Boorganna’ is uncertain, though it is thought that it refers to either the mahogany or lilly pilly trees that thrive in this area. The name ‘Comboyne’ is derived from ‘Wambuyn’, meaning ‘the place of kangaroos’, and indeed you’re likely to spot many of these fascinating native creatures bounding along the plateau, particularly at dawn and dusk.</p>\n<p><b>Preserving for the future</b><br>\nBoorganna Nature Reserve is the second-oldest nature reserve in NSW and an important reminder of the extensive rainforest that once covered the entire Comboyne Plateau. Its deep red fertile soils are ideal for the rainforest and moist hardwood forests that grow here. In 1904, a small area around Rawson Falls was dedicated to the preservation of native flowers and public recreation.</p>\n<p><b>Natural haven<br></b>The reserve is one of the most botanically diverse environments you’re likely to encounter in NSW, with its six types of forest, including subtropical, warm temperate, gully rainforest and wet and dry sclerophyll forest. The reserve forms part of the Tapin Tops/Killabakh regional wildlife corridor, which protects a number of vulnerable species, including yellow-bellied gliders, long-nosed potoroos, parma wallabies, rufous scrub birds and Stephen’s banded snake. Other unique animals that have been recorded here include the spotted-tailed quoll, red-necked pademelon, swamp wallaby, and long-nosed bandicoot.</p>\n<p><b>Winged paradise<br></b>Be sure to bring your binoculars, because birdwatching is one of the reserve’s most rewarding activities, thanks to the 85 species that call this area home. In addition to two vulnerable owls (the masked owl and sooty owl), other threatened species that find sanctuary here include rose robins, yellow-throated scrubwren, crimson rosellas, superb lyrebirds, scarlet honeyeaters, and many more.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Boorganna Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comboyne village (6.5km)</li>\n<li>Wauchope (44km)</li>\n<li>Taree (52km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Comboyne<b>:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel northwest from Comboyne along Comboyne Road .

Come for a day or make a long weekend of it: bring the tent or caravan to Ruins campground for a comfortable base, or consider the different accommodation options in nearby Pacific Palms.</p>\n<p>Start your visit at the scenic Cape Hawke lookout, offering 360 degree views over the surrounding coast. In winter, there’s no better place to spot some whales, so be sure to bring your binoculars. Then there’s pristine beaches like Elizabeth Beach, and Seven Mile Beach.

Take great care when swimming as there may be strong hidden currents and never swim alone.</li>\n</ul>\n","why_you_should_visit":"\n\t\t<p>Booti Booti National Park is a special place, here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><br><b>Spirituality, identity and lifestyle</b><br>\nBooti Booti National Park holds important cultural significance for the Worimi Aboriginal people, who have lived on and used the land and waters for many thousands of years. Dozens of Aboringal sites exist within the park, including artefact scatters, stone quarries, tool sites, and shell middens. These are important markers of Aboriginal history in the region, demonstrating how land, water, plants and animals contributed to – and continue to have significance for Aboriginal identity, spirituality, and lifestyle.</p>\n<p><br><b>Aye, Captain<br></b>Captain Cook first sighted Cape Hawke on May 12, 1770, and named it in honour of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Edward Hawke. The famous explorer and surveyor John Oxley later passed through the area in 1818. The first European inhabitant was Captain J. Gogerly, who sailed between Forster and Sydney ferrying timber, oyster shells, and sandstone. Today you can pay respects to Captain Gogerly and some of his relatives at their gravemarkers, across the road from the Ruins campground.</p>\n<p><br><b>A natural wonderland<br></b>Booti Booti National Park features a substantial number of amphibians and reptiles, including red-bellied black snakes, brown snakes, rose-crowned snakes and blue-bellied swamp snakes. Be sure to keep your distance – some of these species are very dangerous. Goannas are regular visitors to the Ruins campground and picnic areas, and you may even be lucky enough to see a land mullet or water dragon.</p>\n<p><br><b>A haven for birds and birdwatchers alike<br></b>The unusual peninsula between the Pacific Ocean and Wallis Lake provides an outstanding habitat for over 210 species of birds. During April, you can view rainbow and scaley-breasting lorikeets, as well as yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes as they pass through on their annual nomadic trips, following the flowering heath. There are also a substantial number of waterbirds, including pelicans and the endangered little tern.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001030","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Great Lakes (Pacific Palms)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6591 0300<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> \"The Ruins\" Camping Ground, Booti Booti National Park, The Lakes Way, Pacific Palms NSW 2428<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday (closed public holidays)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001031","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nelson Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4984 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 1, 12B Teramby Road, Nelson Bay NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Booti Booti National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pacific Palms (5km)</li>\n<li>Forster (20km)</li>\n<li>Taree (40km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Forster:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head south along the Lakes Way</li>\n<li>It’s 20km to Ruins campground and the Great Lakes Park Office</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Newcastle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north on the Pacific Highway</li>\n<li>Just past Bulahdelah, turn right onto The Lakes Way (signposted ‘Seal Rocks’).</li>\n<li>Follow The Lakes Way for approximately 55km to Pacific Palms</li>\n<li>Continue along The Lakes Way until you see Ruins campground and the Great Lakes Park Office on your right</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>A bus from Sydney or Newcastle to Forster can be stopped at the Ruins campground by asking the driver.

Around 12 million years ago, nearby Mount Canobolas spewed lava over the limestone turning it into marble. Borenore marble, known as Borenore Red, was used in many public buildings in Sydney, including Central railway station. The Strand arcade, as well as countless marble fireplaces, one of which was made for Buckingham Palace.</p>\n<p><b>Protecting the precious</b> <br>\nBorenore Karst Conservation Reserve plays a special role in the preservation of some of Australia’s precious native flora and fauna. A haven for birds, the park is home to thornbills, honeyeaters, kookaburras, magpies, treecreepers, weebills and more. Another special flying creature finding protection here is the eastern bent-winged bat – a threatened species that spends the winter hibernating in Tunnel Cave, before emerging in spring ready to migrate.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal connections</b> <br>\nThe permanent flow of Boree creek and the reliable shelter of caves meant that this area was used for thousands of years by the Wiradyuri people. In fact, the name ‘Borenore’ is believed to be derived from two Wiradyuri words: <i>bora</i> which means ceremony and <i>nora nora</i> meaning shelf or overhanging rock. The reserve remains an important place for Aboriginal people today and protects a number of ancient sites, including Arch Cave which is highly significant for local Aboriginal women as a maternity site.</p>\n<p><b>Mystical adventure</b> <br>\nHome to the ancient Arch Cave, Borenore Karst Conservation Reserve harbours a whole world that thrives in the dark. Light up your head torch and marvel at the stalactites and stalagmites. Listen to the drips of water around you that keep the air moist, the perfect breeding ground for the mosses and lichen surrounding the entrance. The musky smell you will notice is the tell-tale sign that bats are about as the caves are a precious home to these protected species.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001044","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bathurst</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6332 7640<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 2, 203-209 Russell Street, Bathurst NSW 2795<p>To contact the KARST Conservation Unit in this office please call (02) 6332 7680</p><br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Borenore Karst Conservation Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Borenore (5km)</li>\n<li>Orange (17km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Orange:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Forbes Road (also known as the Escort Way) towards Forbes</li>\n<li>Take the signposted turnoff to Borenore Karst Conservation Reserve just past the town of Borenore</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Borenore Karst Conservation Reserve.

Rock shelters adorned with engravings and Aboriginal art, grinding grooves, middens and other archaeological deposits are fascinating to behold, and make a visit to Bouddi National Park a very special experience.</p>\n<p><b>A coastal gem</b> <br>\nLocated south-east of Gosford, the park spans over 1,500 hectares, including the fully-protected Bouddi National Park Marine Extension area. As well as offering pristine beaches and marine habitat, the park’s coastal position boasts million-dollar ocean views, which are best enjoyed from one of its lookouts.</p>\n<p><b>A natural paradise</b> <br>\nA variety of animals and birds live in Bouddi National Park, enjoying its quiet beaches and native vegetation as much as its visitors do. Remember to take your camera as you may be lucky enough to spot a resident sea-eagle, bandicoot or tree frog. Plus, photos of the park’s fascinating rock formations provide excellent memories of your visit.</p>\n<p><b>A must for marine-lovers</b> <br>\nThe 300-hectare Bouddi National Park Marine Extension protects the park’s diverse marine life and is one of Australia’s earliest Marine Protected Areas. The park also offers great whale watching opportunities from one of its many lookouts– spot humpback whales between May and July and again in September and October and southern right whales from late July.</p>\n<p><strong>So many outdoor activities</strong> <br>\nBouddi National Park is the perfect place to enjoy the great outdoors – both in water and on land. From abundant walking tracks, mountain biking trails, fishing spots, campsites, picnic areas and beaches just waiting for swimmers, surfers and snorkellers, this park really does have it all.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>The land of generations</b><br>\nBournda has been a special place for the Dhurga and Yuin people for thousands of years, with its plentiful food supply and quarry for making tools. As you explore the park and its wildlife, it’ll be no surprise that ‘Bournda’ means ‘place of tea tree and kangaroos’. </p>\n<p><strong>Ships ahoy<br></strong>There’s plenty of fascinating heritage in Bournda, dating back to the 1830s when European settlement of the district began. Today, you can still see anchor bolts at Kangarutha Point, which was established as a port with Kianinny Bay in 1859. It's also believed the existing track to the point, and parts of the coastal walk, were once used to supply ships anchored there, and transport produce and passengers.  Some building remains can also be found around Games Bay, which was cleared for dairy farming by settler Mr Games.</p>\n<p><strong>Birdwatchers’ haven</strong><br>\nWith around 200 species of birds in the area, Bournda is a birdwatcher’s paradise. The estuarine wetlands at the eastern end of Wallagoot Lake provide roosting and feeding areas for a large variety of waders and waterfowl. Keep your eyes out for threatened species like the little tern, hooded plover and pied oystercatcher. Bondi Lake is the largest freshwater lake situated behind coastal dunes in the region, and is another important habitat for waterbirds.</p>\n<p><b>Get active<br></b>With so much to do, there’s no excuse not to get active in Bournda. The beaches and waterways offer a range of options for watersport enthusiasts – waterskiing, boating, paddling, sail boarding, fishing, swimming and surfing. The coastal walk is perfect for hikers and those hoping to spot migrating whales. And for cyclists, the roads throughout the park are an extensive network to navigate on your bike.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001061","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Merimbula</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6495 5000<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:FSCR@environment.nsw.gov.au\">FSCR@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Corner Sapphire Coast and Merimbula Drives, Merimbula NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday and some weekends during peak holiday periods</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Bournda National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tathra (10km)</li>\n<li>Merimbula (15km)</li>\n<li>Bega (20km)<br>\nCanberra (253km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Tathra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel south towards Merimbula on Sapphire Coast Drive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Bega:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Tathra Road (Snowy Mountains Highway) toward Tathra</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Sapphire Coast Drive and continue south towards Merimbula</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Merimbula:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north towards Tathra on Sapphire Coast Drive</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Bournda National Park.

This Aboriginal nation is made up of small groups of mostly one or two families, who travelled their country as availability to food sources changed with the seasons. The Biripi harvested native plants, each for a specific use. Identify their food plants, medicinal plants, arts/crafts plants and cultural plants when you visit Brimbin with the help of the <a title=\"Biripi Nation website\" href=\"http://www.ptlalc.com.au/biripi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Biripi Nation website</a>.</p>\n<p><b>The Long Paddock<br></b>The Travelling Stock Route (TSR) in Australia is an authorised thoroughfare for walking domestic lifestock between locations, and these routes are collectively known as “The Long Paddock”. Parts of Brimbin were originally the TSR of a stock camp sold in the 1960s. Old Port Macquarie Road, now part of <a title=\"Ms Kellys walking track\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/brimbin-nature-reserve/ms-kellys-walking-track/walking\" target=\"_self\">Ms Kellys walking track</a>, follows a section of track established in the 1820s linking Port Macquarie to the Australian Agricultural Co. lands at Stroud and Gloucester. The route allowed bullock-drawn carts to cross Dawson River.</p>\n<p><b>Shady grove<br></b>The name ‘Brimbin’ comes from a local Aboriginal word for ‘stringybark’, which are common to the reserve, as are white mahogany, tallowwood and turpentine. Narrow-leaved red gums provide important food and habitat for koalas. Grey myrtle, swamp oak and water gum can be found along the waterways, with mangroves lining the banks below the tidal limit. River mangrove is usually a bushy shrub, with elongated fruit and clustered white flowers that smell like banana. Its main identifying feature is salt encrustation on its spoon-shaped leaves. Grey mangroves grow, in this area, to around 10m, and have oval pointed leaves, pale green flattened fruit and spongy pencil-like aerial roots spreading from the base of the trunk.</p>\n<p><b>Feathering the nest<br></b>Manning Valley has over 260 different species of bird, many of which inhabit Brimbin, making it an ideal spot for birdwatching. Nests can be seen along waterways. Due to the range of plant communities within the reserve and its proximity to the coast, waterbirds, raptors, woodland and seabirds can be seen at Brimbin. This includes the largest owl on the Australian continent: the powerful owl.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001034","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Taree</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6552 4097<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 78 Hargreaves Street, Taree NSW 2430<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Brimbin Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taree (12km)</li>\n<li>Port Macquarie (92km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (177km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Taree:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive 6km northwest on Wingham Road</li>\n<li>Turn right at Cedar Party Road</li>\n<li>Continue for 6km then turn right at Old Port Macquarie Road</li>\n<li>Travel through Yarratt State Forest and follow signs to Brimbin Nature Reserve</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Brimbin Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal history</b><br>\nBrindabella National Park lies within the tribal boundaries of the Ngunawal, Wolgalu and Wiradjuri people. To this day, the area has a spiritual significance to Aboriginal people. Mount Coree, which stands tall on the western side of the park, is named after the Aboriginal word for moth. Before European settlement, the area was a hunting ground for bogong moths.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b><br>\nBrindabella includes several remains of the network of alpine huts that were once scattered throughout the Australian Alps. Visit Hume Sawmill in the north or head west to see McIntyres Hut on the Goodradigbee River. The original hut was built by Les McIntyre in 1948 as a fishing hut, but was burnt down in the late 1990s and was rebuilt by a group of keen 4WDers.</p>\n<p><b>Adventure abounds</b><br>\nBrindabella offers a network of alpine trails just waiting to be explored by 4WD or trail bike. There are also several options for bushwalkers to explore the park, and even the opportunity to go horse riding on tracks from Doctors Flat Road northwards. Stay overnight at one of the remote campgrounds, or visit for the day and enjoy a leisurely picnic on the banks of the Goodradigbee River.</p>\n<p><b>Wildlife wonders</b><br>\nBrindabella’s unique alpine and sub-alpine environment is home to many native animals, including threatened mammals like the spotted-tailed quoll or the yellow-bellied glider. With over 80 different species of birds seen in the park, it’s also a birdwatchers haven. Look out for the yellow-tailed black cockatoo and peregrine falcon flying overhead, and have your binoculars handy to spot threatened species like the powerful owl, pink robin and olive whistler.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001027","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Queanbeyan (National Parks and Wildlife)</h3>\n    <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6229 7166<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:info@environment.nsw.gov.au\">info@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 11 Farrer Street, Queanbeyan NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001064","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tumut</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6947 7025<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:tumutrvc@environment.nsw.gov.au\">tumutrvc@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> The Old Butter Factory, Adelong Road, Tumut<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Brindabella National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Canberra (30km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Canberra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel west along Uriarra Road to Brindabella Road</li>\n<li>The dirt road starts along Brindabella Road, which takes you to the southern edge of Brindabella National Park.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Brindabella National Park is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Brindabella National Park.

The flat, exposed areas of Hawkesbury sandstone within the park provide an ideal ‘canvas’ for Aboriginal artists, and there are hundreds of rock engraving sites throughout the park. Aboriginal sites on Hawkesbury sandstone have a distinctive style of engraving which is unique in Australia. The Bulgandry Aboriginal  engraving site at Kariong is an excellent example of rock art within the park and is easily accessible.<br><br><b>Stretch your legs<br></b>Brisbane Water National Park offers great ways to get amongst nature – why not hop on your mountain bike and get your adrenalin pumping along the Tommos loop and Rocky Ponds cycling route? Or you can wear out your walking shoes along the Girrakool loop walking track. For the more energetic, the park is a hiker’s delight. Longer treks range from an hour or two to overnight on sections of the Great North walk, which passes through the park on its way from Sydney to Newcastle. <b><br><br>\nA wonderland of wildflowers<br></b>Located 12km from Gosford, the park covers 12,000ha of rugged sandstone country, and boarders the Hawkesbury river, which feeds cascading waterfalls. The landscape is gorgeous all year round, especially from late winter to early spring when it comes alive with colourful wildflowers. <b><br><br>\nA haven for wildlife<br></b>Brisbane Water National Park is home to an incredible 270 native animal species, including the threatened spotted tailed quoll. Keep your eyes peeled for koalas munching on eucalypt leaves high up in the tree tops.

These people continue, today, to actively celebrate their rich culture and heritage. Notable Bundjalung People include musician Troy Cassar-Daley, boxer Anthony Mundine, Australian Aboriginal leader Warren Mundine and chef Mark Olive.</p>\n<p><b>Wartime stories<br></b>Airforce Beach seems like an unlikely name for a pristine stretch of sand near a national park, but during World War II the airfield at Evans Head was used as a training ground. No. 1 Air Observers School was stationed there until it disbanded in 1943.</p>\n<p><b>Stunning landscapes<br></b>There’s a surprisingly wide variety of vegetation landscapes in this park including coastal heathland, coastal swamp, open eucalypt forest, wetlands and littoral rainforest. Banksia is particularly prevalent as is paperbark. There’s also a healthy display of wildflowers during spring, which include swamp lilies, sun orchids, Christmas bells and golden bush peas.</p>\n<p><b>Winged things<br></b>Broadwater is a refuge for migratory shorebirds, a hunting ground for birds of prey and habitat for a broad range of birds that inhabit the park’s various plant communities. These include threatened species such as pied oystercatchers, little terns and beach stone curlews. White-bellied sea eagles can also often be seen trawling the coastline. This raptor is widely revered by Aboriginal people in many parts of Australia. An opportunistic carnivore, you may be lucky enough to see one of these birds seizing waterborne prey in its talons as it flies low over the water.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b><br>\nBroken Head Nature Reserve is co-managed by NPWS and the Arakwal People, acknowledging the cultural significance of this land to Aboriginal People. Three Sisters, previously known as Cocked Hat Rocks, is an important cultural site representing a story about a young Aboriginal woman who was caught in a strong current when swimming in this area. When her sister attempted to save her, they both drowned and were transformed into stone. This story was told to warn children not to swim in the strong and dangerous currents here.</p>\n<p><b>Botanical wonders<br></b>Whether you’re a botanist or just a nature-lover, it’s not hard to appreciate the incredible biodiversity at Broken Head. This small reserve protects three endangered plant communities: littoral and lowland rainforest, headland grasses and woodlands. There are 240 different plant species here, 12 of which are threatened in NSW and six in Australia, such as the white lace flower rainforest tree, which you might see standing tall along the entrance road in summer dotted with fluffy white ball flowers.</p>\n<p><b>Rich bird and animal life<br></b>Broken Head Nature Reserve is a haven for birdwatchers and animal-lovers. Thanks to the plentiful supply of food on the NSW North Coast, the area is visited by many migratory and nomadic birds, flying-foxes and micro-bats. Three Sisters lookout is a great place for birdwatching and spotting migrating whales in winter and spring. Wandering along the beaches and in the rainforest, you’re sure to meet locals like brush turkeys patrolling the understorey in their search for food. But you might also be lucky enough to spot threatened species like the colourful wompoo fruit-dove, with its spectacular green, purple, and yellow plumage.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"},{"name":"Whale watching","id":"{72F41C54-2547-4547-9148-8F1DC268CF47}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001068","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Byron Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6620 9300<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:cape.byron@environment.nsw.gov.au\">cape.byron@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Tallow Beach Road, Byron Bay NSW 2481<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Broken Head Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Byron Bay (4km)</li>\n<li>Ballina (31km)</li>\n<li>Gold Coast (90km)</li>\n<li>Brisbane (165km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Byron Bay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south on Broken Head Road</li>\n<li>Approximately 2km south of Suffolk Park , turn left into Broken Head Reserve Road.</li>\n<li>Continue 3km to the end and you’ll arrive at the picnic area and Broken Head Beach</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Ballina:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive north through Lennox Head on Byron Bay Road</li>\n<li>Continue for approximately 12km</li>\n<li>Turn right into Broken Head Reserve Road</li>\n<li>Continue 3km to the end and you’ll arrive at the picnic area and Broken Head Beach</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Broken Head Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Land of plenty<br></b>Brunswick Heads Nature Reserve lies within the traditional land of the Bundjalung people. The area, once a campground, continues to provide a ready source of food such as dugum (pipis) and julum (fish). Harrys Hill is known as ‘Durrungbil’, which means ‘water rat’. When viewed from the south side of Brunswick River at the right angle, the profile of that water rat can clearly be seen.</p>\n<p><b>Safe haven<br></b>Thirty-six threatened plant species have been recorded in the reserve. Brunswick Heads is a stronghold for many endangered rainforest plants that are either at the southern limit of their distribution or not found in many other places in New South Wales. These include Queensland xylosma, scented acronychia, durobby and white lace flower. The reserve also supports six endangered ecological communities (EEC), including littoral rainforest, swamp sclerophyll forest and coastal saltmarsh.</p>\n<p><b>A home by the beach<br></b>Forty-three threatened animal species have been recorded in the reserve. These include a range of creatures from the enormous humpback whale, which can seasonally be seen off the coast, to the world’s smallest fruit bat called common blossom, which is just 6cm long. Other threatened animals include the grey-headed flying fox, wallum froglet, long-nosed potoroo and koala. Critically endangered loggerhead turtles and vulnerable green turtles sometimes nest on New Brighton Beach. Brunswick Heads Nature Reserve is also home to threatened pied oystercatchers, sooty oystercatchers and beach stone-curlews.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001068","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Byron Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6620 9300<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:cape.byron@environment.nsw.gov.au\">cape.byron@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Tallow Beach Road, Byron Bay NSW 2481<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001043","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tweed Area Office</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6670 8600<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 1/135 Main St Murwillumbah NSW 2484<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Brunswick Heads Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mullumbimby (8.5km)</li>\n<li>Byron Bay (18km)</li>\n<li>Ballina (42km)</li>\n<li>Lismore (51km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Ocean Shores:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel east along Orana Road</li>\n<li>At Warrambool Road roundabout, turn left to stay on Orana Road.</li>\n<li>Continue along Orana Road, which becomes Strand Avenue.</li>\n<li>Turn right onto North Head Road and drive all the way to the end of the gravel road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Brunswick Heads Nature Reserve.

At the southern end, <a title=\"Mount Budawang trail\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/budawang-national-park/mount-budawang-trail/walking\">Mount Budawang trail</a> is a difficult but rewarding hike to the mountain summit, where you can take in 360-degree views of the surrounding landscape.</p>\n<p>As most of the park is a declared wilderness area, vehicles and horses are only permitted on Long Gully Road, and cycling is only permitted on Long Gully Road and the Boundary and Dingo trails.</p>","fees":"","opening_times":"<p>Budawang National Park is always open but may have to close at times due to poor weather or fire danger.</p>","safety_and_supplies_information":"","why_you_should_visit":"\n\t\t<p>Budawang National Park is a special place. Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage<br></b>Once European settlers arrived, early exploration of the area concentrated on finding routes across the rugged escarpment country to link the tablelands and coast. Many of the ancient Aboriginal pathways became an important part of the early bridle trail network used for movement of stock. One of these was Wog Wog track, which was used to move cattle from Braidwood to the coast.</p>\n<p><b>A natural haven<br></b>Budawang supports a wide variety of trees and plants, so budding naturalists will find much of interest here. The eastern slopes of the range contain tall eucalypt forests, temperate rainforest, and several threatened species. There are Budawang ash and pinkwoods as well. Higher up, on the summits of Mount Budawang and Currockbilly Mountain, visitors can see the endemic species of Budawang wallaby grass – it doesn’t grow anywhere else in the world.</p>\n<p><b>Fascinating landscapes<br></b>Southern Budawang Range is formed on Devonian sediments that were uplifted to form the Budawang Synclinorium. Volcanic rock on the slopes slowly transforms into fertile soil that supports the varied ecosystems of tall moist forest and rainforest. The altitude range in the park is more than 800 metres, though two peaks in the park – Mount Budawang and Currockbilly Mountain – rise to over 1,100m above sea level.<br></p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001060","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4887 7270<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Morton National Park, Nowra Road, Fitzroy Falls NSW 2577<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Budawang National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Braidwood (25km)</li>\n<li>Batemans Bay (40km)</li>\n<li>Ulladulla (45km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Milton to Long Gully:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the signs to Pigeon House Mountain Didthul.</li>\n<li>Rather than turning onto Pigeon House Road, continue on Yadboro Road and cross Clyde River, merging onto the Western Distributor.</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Long Gully Road and continue to the campground</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Braidwood or Mongarlowe to Mount Budawang:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From Charleys Forest Road or Little River Road, turn onto Northangera Road through Mongarlowe, then onto Budawang Road near the fire station.</li>\n<li>Travel a further 1.8 km, then veer right at the intersection through a gate.</li>\n<li>Follow the signs for another 5km to the carpark.

At this much-loved tourism destination, you can wander raised boardwalks and explore the rainforest that once blanketed much of the region. For the ultimate experience, combine the Rainforest loop walk and The Falls walk and discover exquisite plants and animals in breathtaking surroundings.</p>\n<p><b>A splash of relaxation</b><br>\nIf you’ve ever fallen asleep to the sounds of a relaxation CD, you’ll know the peaceful power of waterfalls. And with its own wonderful falls, Budderoo might just be one of the most relaxing places around. Walk to Minnamurra Falls, an amazing double-tiered waterfall, or Carrington Falls, with its fabulous 50m drop. Sit back, listen to the hypnotic sound of flowing water and let your cares drift away.</p>\n<p><b>Walk through history<br></b>A walk around the park reveals its many uses over the years. Spot remaining cedar trees, so prized by foresters in the 1800s. Head downstream from the Minnamurra Rainforest to see the 1853 Kelly’s Cottage and its camellia tree, believed to be one of the southern hemisphere’s oldest. The land’s rich soil and water supply make it ideal for dairy farming – and you can still see the monument to Australia’s first butter factory in nearby Jamberoo Valley.</p>\n<p><b>Park life<br></b>You’re almost guaranteed to see wildlife in the park – particularly if you visit Minnamurra Rainforest Centre. Look for bowerbirds and king parrots, and visit between June and August for the spectacular image of a male lyrebird displaying his tail. You’ve a good chance of spotting a swamp wallaby at dawn or dusk, and keep an eye out for an eastern water dragon or perhaps even a diamond python soaking up the sunshine.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001059","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Minnamurra Rainforest Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4236 0469<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Budderoo National Park, Minnamurra Falls Road (Tourist Drive No.9), via Jamberoo NSW 2533<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Budderoo National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kiama (15km)</li>\n<li>Bowral (30km)</li>\n<li>Nowra (50km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (50km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>The main visitor areas of Budderoo National Park are Minnamurra Rainforest Centre near Jamberoo and Carrington Falls near Robertson.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Once upon a time<br></b>The park lies across the traditional lands of the Njunawal tribal group, the northwest corner of the Wandandian tribal territory and the southern boundary of the Gandangara tribal group. The ridge tops were almost certainly travel routes as people shifted in accordance with the seasonal availability of food. Evidence of campsites exists on the main plateau and limestone dolines contain edible plants consumed or used by Aboriginal people.</p>\n<p><b>Adventure central<br></b>Known as the adventure capital of the Southern Tablelands, Bungonia is a place to really test your limits. There are around 200 ‘wild’ caves in the park, many of which are open for experienced cavers to explore, so you’ll be spoilt for choice. For an exciting journey of waterfalls and plunge pools, Bungonia Creek and Jerrara Creek are the most popular canyoning spots. Bungonia Slot Canyon provides one of the few opportunities in Australia for climbing limestone and is as dramatic a place to scale a rock wall as its name suggests.</p>\n<p><b>This old thing<br></b>This park is one of the oldest in New South Wales. It was first protected as a water reserve in 1872, which was also the same year the world’s first national park –Yellowstone in USA – was established. Just as Yellowstone’s geothermal features pull the crowds, Bungonia’s stunning geomorphology, both above and belowground, are its main draw. Louis Guymer was the park’s first caretaker (1889–1909), who discovered caves and erected gates and ladders, some of which you may use during your visit.</p>\n<p><b>Furry friends<br></b>The Large bent-wing bat not only has a name that’s hard to say five times very fast, but is classified as vulnerable. Certain caves are closed during the year to help provide a safe environment for breeding and hibernation. Look out for a colony, cloud or cauldron of them as you explore the limestone labyrinths of their natural habitat. A small population of koalas, classified as threatened, also inhabit the park.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001132","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bungonia local office</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4844 4277.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal legend<br></b>Traditionally, Burning Mountain was part of a vast territory owned by the Wanaruah people, which stretched from Broke to the Liverpool Range. Wanaruah mythology, passed through generations, tells the story of Burning Mountain like this: one day, the Gumaroi people, north of the Liverpool Range, sent a raiding party south to steal Wanaruah women. The Wiradjuri people to the west warned the Wanaruah, who sent their best warriors out for a great battle. One of the Wanaruah wives decided to wait for her husband to return, settling down near the Liverpool Range. When he didn’t come back, she was devastated. Crying, she asked Biami, the sky god, to take her life. Instead, he turned her into stone, and as she did so, her tears became fire and set the mountain alight for all eternity.</p>\n<p><b>An unusual geological event<br></b>The scientific explanation for Burning Mountain is a slowly combusting coal seam. At the moment, the exact location of the fire is a mystery, though we know it’s about 30m below the ground and heading south – meaning Burning Mountain actually moves at about 1m a year. It’s estimated the fire has been burning for as much as 5,500 years, and as it eats through the coal, rocks slip into the gap, causing fissures and slumping at the surface level. Be sure to wear sturdy footwear and stay on the formed track. Not only that, but watch out for fossils, too: 200 million years ago, this entire area was covered by ocean.</p>\n<p><b>The colonial story</b> <br>\nThe Liverpool Range was always a difficult barrier to the sweeping plains beyond, which colonial settlers coveted for their potential as rich grazing land. Throughout the 1800s, many explorers tried different routes across the area, from ‘Pandora’s Pass’, first crossed by Allan Cunningham in 1823, to the Hanging Rock area, first crossed by Henry Dangar.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ancient lands<br></b>Part of the Nattai (name given to the river because it had 'sweet water') Reserves System, which is the traditional home of the D'harawal and Gundangarra Aboriginal people, the northern part of Burragorang is also home to the Dharug people. In Aboriginal, ‘Burragorang’ means ‘home or place of the giant kangaroo’. These lands provided a corridor for people travelling northward from as far afield as Victoria. They were heading to major gathering and ceremonial grounds in D'harawal lands in the Cowpastures or Camden area, adjacent to Nepean River.</p>\n<p><b>World watching<br></b>Although the park isn't part of Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area or Kanangra-Boyd National Park, both of these areas can be seen from Burragorang lookout. This is also the best spot to see the impressive expanse of Warragamba Dam. More than 80 per cent of Sydney’s water supply comes from here, which makes it NSW’s most precious water resource.</p>\n<p><b>Wings spread<br></b>You’ll probably hear them before you can see them: noisy glossy black cockatoos, yellow-tail cockatoos and gang-gangs feed on the casuarinas at the northern area of the picnic area. They’re not the only birds you’ll find here, though. Satin bowerbirds, catbirds (listen for their distinctive meow-type calls) and lyrebirds have also been known to visit the heath and red gums in this part of Burragorang.</p>\n<p><b>Perfect play<br></b>It's a great spot for kids. The roads are sealed, quiet, and good for bike riding; best accompanied by an adult of course. There’s a playground and plenty of opportunities to watch for local furry and feathery residents; keep an eye out as the eagles swoop past the lookout and rest in the trees around the picnic area.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001019","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Picton</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4640 0500<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 99 Menangle Street, Picton NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Burragorang State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Camden (20km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (80km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Camden:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Take Druitt Lane, which turns into Burragorang Road, to Nattai.</li>\n<li>Continue to the lookout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Picton:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Take Barkers Lodge Road to Oakdale</li>\n<li>Travel west to Nattai</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW transport info website\" href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>Spring is a great time of year at Burragorang State Conservation Area.

The pipi midden (shell mound) at The Pass is one of the largest and oldest in far north NSW.</p>\n<p><b>Cape Byron Lighthouse</b><br>\nPerched high above Byron Bay’s glorious coastline, historic Cape Byron lighthouse was constructed on this rugged headland in 1901. Its landmark 22m high white tower houses the light that still illuminates the bay of an evening. To find out more about the lighthouse <a title=\"take a tour\" href=\"http://www.wildwildworld.com.au/WWW/Search/SearchActivity.aspx?Park=20080416100010409&amp;Region=&amp;StartDate=from&amp;EndDate=to&amp;ShowNonDateEvents=False\" target=\"_blank\">take a tour</a> with an expert guide and be sure to check out the Maritime Museum.</p>\n<p><b>Lighthouse keeper’s cottages</b><br>\nIn days gone by, lighthouse keepers were responsible for igniting the lighthouse’s light of an evening. The keepers have long been replaced by automated light systems; however the Victorian Georgian style cottages in which they lived remain as heritage listed buildings. Today they operate as holiday accommodation, having been carefully restored to offer modern convenience while retaining their historical charm and an insight into the life of a lighthouse keeper.</p>\n<p><b>View from the top</b><br>\nThe best way to appreciate the unparalleled beauty of this park is via the Cape Byron walking track. This exhilarating 3.7km walk takes in coastal cliffs, coastal rainforest and superb beaches.

Here are some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Old-growth ecosystems<br></b>Although much of Carrai’s forested area has been affected in some way by human habitation – logging and grazing, for example – it has been protected for decades, allowing it to recover. There are three old-growth forest ecosystems in the park, including groves of white mahogany, dry redgum, bloodwood, native apple, and tallowwood. Look for the endangered Guthrie’s grevillea, with its green and maroon flowers, as well as epiphytic orchids attached to the trunks of trees.</p>\n<p><b>Wild population<br></b>Vast tracts of remote forest, like those at Carrai, are essential for keeping the populations of native animals at high levels. This area is known to harbour endangered species like the Hastings River mouse, a rodent that likes damp habitats, and the giant barred frog, which grows to a size of about 12cm and lays its eggs on banks overhanging rivers. Listen for its deep grunt when you stop by a creek.</p>\n<p><b>Indigenous heritage<br></b>The Carrai plateau is a special place for the Thunggutti people, with many ceremonial sites that have their origins in the dreamtime. It’s believed that Aboriginal people moved from the coastal hinterlands to the New England Tablelands, including parts of what is now Carrai National Park, during the summer months. In the early to mid-1800s, the rugged country at the head of Macleay River also provided refuge for many Aboriginal people.</p>\n<p><b>From the 1800s<br></b>In many ways, Carrai’s remote location has protected it from extensive grazing and mining. In 1818, John Oxley was the first European to visit the New England Tablelands, closely followed by cedar loggers. Graziers eventually moved their stock up river valleys onto the tablelands. Both tin and gold were mined in the area until the 1960s, and forestry ceased in the early 90s.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001037","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Walcha</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6777 4700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 188W North Street, Walcha NSW 2354<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Carrai National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Armidale (200km)</li>\n<li>Kempsey (100km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (650km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Armidale, head to Walcha and take the Oxley Highway to Kangaroo Flat Road.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>History revealed<br></b>At the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, all over Dorrigo Plateau, the land was being opened up for dairy farming and cropping. Soon after, red cedar and hoop pine was targeted by loggers. A rail line was opened in 1924 to Glenreagh, and a network of tramlines carried timber from the forests to the mills at Cascade. The four lines in Cascade National Park and nearby Nymboi–Binderay and Dorrigo national parks are of heritage significance, and today the relics of the past logging life can be seen around Cascade village and on Moonpar Forest drive.</p>\n<p><b>Adventures galore<br></b>There’s a full range of adventures, from the gentle to the more active, in Cascade National Park. For those who like mountain biking, there’s Cascade ride. All ages can enjoy walking beneath the ancient trees on either Box Ridge or Mobong tracks. There’s also a driving route that traverses both Cascade and the southern reaches of Nymboi–Binderay national parks. Bring your binoculars for birdwatching, and a picnic for refuelling.</p>\n<p><b>A natural palette of colours<br></b>Cascade National Park combines warm temperate and subtropical rainforest filled with coachwood, crab apple, booyong and even hoop pine. Antarctic beech can also be found within its boundaries. In December, Dorrigo waratah blooms, showing off its spectacular red flowers. In the wet eucalypt forests, brush box, tallowwood and Sydney blue gums flourish.</p>\n<p><b>Wildlife abound<br></b>The rainforest here teems with birds and animals both day and night. During daylight hours, be as still as possible and watch out for the beautiful lyrebird, brush turkeys, bowerbirds and other rainforest species.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>True colours<br></b>Flax lily, pixie cap, wax lip may sound like celebrity names, but they’re also flowering plants and understory shrubs you’ll find in the park. Most wildflowers emerge in spring, but ground orchids bloom at various times of the year and banksias always display their orange flowers. Keep a particular eye out for the Montane green five-corners, with its single hanging yellow-green flowers and bristly branches with broad spikey leaves. This threatened plant only grows on granite soils in or near the park. In the moister protected forests, look out for concentrated areas of wattle, where broad-leaf hickory, silver and fern leaf wattle flower in late winter and early spring. Compare their puffballs and choose your favourite shade of yellow.</p>\n<p><b>It’s a wild life<br></b>Eastern grey kangaroos graze in the open grassy areas of the park alongside red-necked and swamp wallabies, and wallaroos, Flocks of glossy black cockatoos fly across the sky in spectacular formation. Carnivorous skinks stretch out on sun-warmed boulders, while wedge-tailed eagles glide in graceful circles around the highest granite tors. The rose robin darts and tumbles in its wet forest habitat and forages for food high in the canopy. At night, the threatened brush-tailed phascogales and spotted-tailed quolls emerge. Whether you’re picnicking, out on a mid-morning walk, or perched on a boulder at dusk, you can animal-gaze and birdwatch here to your heart’s content.</p>\n<p><b>Stepping out<br></b>From a stroll to a scramble, you can take it easy or work muscles you didn’t know you had when walking in the park. Hiking tracks are easily accessible from the campgrounds and the longest track – the Barokee to Native Dog Creek walk – can be started from either end. Off-track opportunities are also available for those who are experienced and well-equipped.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001040","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Dorrigo Rainforest Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6657 2309<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Dorrigo Rainforest Centre, Dome Road, Dorrigo NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday, 9:00am-4:30pm weekends, (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Cathedral Rock National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ebor (5km)</li>\n<li>Dorrigo (60km)</li>\n<li>Armidale (70km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Armidale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive east on Barney Street, which soon becomes Grafton Road and later Waterfall Way (all State Route 78) for 70km, passing through Argyle and Wollomombi.</li>\n<li>To access Barokee campground, take the Round Mountain Road turnoff on the left and after 8km of narrow gravel road, turn right into the campground.</li>\n<li>To access Native Dog campground, which is in the northern section of the park, continue for a few more kilometres along Waterfall Way (78) until it intersects with Guyra Road and then turn left.

The park protects a number of ancient Aboriginal sites that are evidence of the Darug people’s ancient connection to the land, you may find axe grinding grooves on rocks as well as rock engravings and art.</p>\n<p><b>Colonial history</b><br>\nCattai National Park is significant because it includes a parcel of land granted to First Fleet assistant surgeon Thomas Arndell. Cattai Farm and the surrounding area was home to seven generations of Arndell’s, with the land remaining with descendents of Thomas Arndell for about 180 years. Today, several historic sites invite observation and journeying into the past; Arndell's 1821 homestead, convict-built walls and roads, grain silos and ruins of a windmill believed to be Australia’s oldest industrial building.</p>\n<p><b>An important landscape</b><br>\nCattai National Park lies within the Cumberland Plain, an important land system near Sydney that has been impacted by agricultural processes and urban development. Mitchell Park is significant because it contains much of its original vegetation, including paper bark, red gum, stringy bark, grey gum and cabbage palms. The best way to see the changing vegetation is along the Mitchell Park track – you’ll notice that each part of the walk is named to describe the type of vegetation along that part of the walk.</p>\n<p><b>A birder’s bounty</b><br>\nThe park’s riverside location, close to Long Lagoon, makes it popular with birdwatchers. Spot vulnerable black bitterns, powerful owls or rufous night herons.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>The reserve lies within the traditional land of the Bong Bong people. Cultural, linguistic and spiritual knowledge associated with this area continue to be passed on today. NPWS works in collaboration with local Aboriginal communities to protect this rich heritage.</p>\n<p><b>Who was Cecil Hoskins?<br></b>When the reserve was gazetted in 1975, it was named after Sir Cecil Hoskins. This man was a local resident for 40 years who not only had a keen interest in creating parks and gardens, but also contributed to the purchase of the land for the reserve.</p>\n<p><b>The weir and the wherefore<br></b>Bong Bong weir was built in the 1920s to create a water supply for Moss Vale. The lagoon and swamp areas, which developed as a result of this weir, were declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1932. During the 1965-8 drought, Wingecarribee Council considered destroying the weir to allow water to be released for Berrima Cement Works, situated downstream. This proposal was so strongly opposed by the local community, however, that the idea was abandoned.</p>\n<p><b>Putting roots down<br></b>The reserve supports stands of Paddys River box, native to the Moss Vale district and south of Jenolan, as well as snow gum banksia and a range of other native species. The lagoon itself is deep enough for large aquatic plants to thrive, such as tall spikerush, ribbonweed, yellow bladderwort and water milfoil. Other aquatic species include water snowflake, starwort, water primrose, river buttercup and nardoo.</p>\n<p><b>Wetland creatures<br></b>Over 90 bird species inhabit the reserve and around one third of these, including pacific black ducks, black swans, dusky moorhens and grey teals, are waterbirds that are dependent on the lagoon. So if you’re keen on birdwatching, be sure to bring your binoculars along. Platypus and kangaroos also make their homes in and around the lagoon.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001060","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4887 7270<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Morton National Park, Nowra Road, Fitzroy Falls NSW 2577<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Cecil Hoskins Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moss Vale (3.5km)</li>\n<li>Bowral (7km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (120km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Moss Vale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north on Argyle Street/The Highland Way</li>\n<li>Cross Bong Bong Bridge over Wingecarribee River, then turn right after 300m.</li>\n<li>Drive to the end of this road and stop at the reserve carpark</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Cecil Hoskins Nature Reserve.

Clyde River, or Bhundoo as the locals call it, has provided an abundant food source for Aboriginal people for thousands of years. Several middens have been found along the shores where there are freshwater soaks and flat areas suitable for camping. The river, islands, and surrounding bushlands also have important cultural significance for the Walbunja people. Holmes lookout is part of a local dreaming story and was most likely an important meeting and communication point due to its high vantage point.</p>\n<p><b>Protecting the unique<br></b>As you enjoy the natural beauty of the Clyde River National Park, you’ll see the unique plants and animals protected here. The park has patches of rare forest red gum and three endangered ecological communities; swamp oak floodplain forest; river-flat eucalypt forest on coastal floodplains; and coastal saltmarsh. The park is also home to the glossy black-cockatoo, masked owl and the yellow-bellied glider – so keep your eyes out for these threatened species.</p>\n<p><b>Waterway wonders<br></b>The waterways of Clyde River offer plenty of options to explore and enjoy. Launch your boat, kayak or canoe to see the natural beauty here from the water. Explore the shorelines paddling along the river and see the abundant birdlife.

Deep narrow valleys, folded and eroded rock faces and delightful waterfalls mean that the view is always changing. For a dramatic overview of the plains, take Jacks Creek or Mount Brogden walking tracks.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>This is Wiradjuri country, and the many Aboriginal sites within Cocoparra National Park suggest intensive use during winter and spring when food resources became scarce along rivers, with surface water available in the protected valleys of the range.

Look out for the locally-threatened glossy-black cockatoo drinking from dams at dusk or quietly feeding on the seeds of the drooping she-oak. You may also see the many endangered woodland birds such as the hooded robin, speckled warbler, varied sittella, grey-crowned babbler, diamond firetail or shy heathwren. You can also visit the nesting grounds of the peregrine falcon at Falcon Falls.</p>\n<p><b>Beautifully varied habitats<br></b>The rugged, craggy landscape of the Cocoparra Range produces a great variety of habitats. You’ll find woodlands and forests occupied by white cypress pine, Dwyer’s mallee gum, kurrajong, yellow box and many more during your bushwalks.

Look-At-Me-Now Headland near Emerald Beach is a great vantage point, but locals agree Woolgoolga Headland is your best bet for glimpsing humpbacks. In fact, it’s also known as ‘Whale Watch Headland’. Plan a trip between June and October to see this inspiring sight.</p>\n<p><b>Life’s a beach</b><br>\nGolden beaches are the park’s premier attraction. Here, everything revolves around the water – whether you’re swimming and surfing in it, or walking and fishing beside it. Spend your days discovering the headland walking tracks, boat ramps, parklands and playgrounds. And no matter where you go, you’re bound to find a perfect spot for a beachside picnic.</p>\n<p><b>Fun for Fido</b><br>\nThere are plenty of dog-friendly areas at Coffs Coast Regional Park – just another of its popular features. Take your dog for a walk along one of the coastal paths, plus, there are several beaches with leash-free zones, meaning your pooch can zip about and enjoy the sand and sea as much as you do. The leash-free area around Corindi and Pipeclay beaches is a local favourite – be sure to check the zoning signs and don’t forget the tennis ball.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001039","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coffs Harbour</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6652 0900<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 32 Marina Drive, Coffs Harbour NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Coffs Coast Regional Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (1km)</li>\n<li>Woolgoolga (1km)</li>\n<li>Urunga (30km)</li>\n<li>Bellingen (35km)</li>\n<li>Nambucca Heads (50km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>Coffs Coast Regional Park is accessible in several places from the Pacific Highway.

It’s a great place for the kids to get in touch with their inner adventurer, so plan a break during the school holidays and get them out on the lakes fishing or canoeing, surfing the waves on one of the local beaches, or riding along bush tracks on their mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>Base yourself at one of the local villages – Berrara or Bendalong, for example – or stay at Ulladulla or Sussex Inlet, both of which are slightly bigger townships.</p>\n<p>If you’re only around for the day, head to Monument Beach picnic area. From here, you can walk to the Walter Hood monument. Take along some lunch, and expect to see some kangaroos and wallabies.</p>","fees":"","opening_times":"<p>Conjola National Park is always open but may have to close at times due to poor weather or fire danger.</p>","safety_and_supplies_information":"","why_you_should_visit":"\n\t\t<p>Conjola National Park is a special place. Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal influence<br></b>The land around Conjola National Park has been home for the Budawang and Yuin people for about 6000 years. There are many Aboriginal sites in the area, including middens, campsites and rock shelters. At Fishermans Rock, the midden contains fragments of mussels and mud oysters that were once meals for the local Aboriginal people. You’ll also see some axe-grinding grooves in the sandstone.</p>\n<p><b>Driving force<br></b>You can easily explore Conjola from the comfort of your car. Some of the tracks and trails that take you through forests, past the lakes and to the ocean are even accessible for 2WD vehicles in dry weather. One of the most popular drives is from Cudmirrah to Monument Beach picnic ground, following Goonawarra Drive, Blackbutt Road and Cedar Road. Just take care as you’re driving along, because you’ll be sharing the trails with cyclists, walkers and horse-riders as well as wildlife, which also cross the tracks mainly in the early morning and late afternoon.</p>\n<p><b>Maritime monument<br></b>In 1870, 12 men lost their lives when the clipper <i>Walter Hood</i> struck rocks off the coast between Bendalong and Berrara. There’s a monument, erected in 1927, marking the burial site of the drowned captain and crew a short walk from the Monument Beach picnic area.</p>\n<p><b>Lively lakes<br></b>As well as providing the perfect place for swimming, canoeing, fishing and water sports, the three lakes adjacent to the park – Conjola, Berringer and Swan – are a significant habitat for many birds, such as little terns, the endangered hooded plover and pied oystercatchers. So, best bring your binoculars.</p>\n<p><b>Animal planet<br></b>With open forests and scrubland, there are plenty of places to find Conjola’s wildlife. Keep your eyes peeled for eastern grey kangaroos, wombats, echidnas, brushtail possums and gliders, along with a huge range of cockatoos and parrots, black swans and herons.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001220","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Ulladulla</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4454 9500<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Blackburn Industrial Estate, Lot 9 Coller Road, Ullladulla NSW</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001190","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nowra</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4423 2170<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 55 Graham Street, Nowra NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Conjola National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Sussex Inlet (3km)</li>\n<li>Ulladulla (35km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (165km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>Conjola National Park is accessible via a number of points along the Princes Highway – look for the signposts to particular areas.</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>From Sussex Inlet, take The Springs Road to Goonawarra Drive and other park roads.</li>\n<li>From Ulladulla or Bendalong, turn north from Bendalong Road onto Cedar Road to reach the Monument Beach picnic area.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Conjola National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>The Aboriginal connection<br></b>Before Europeans arrived, the area was the traditional domain of the Ngaamba People. Research suggests that they once used the dramatic cliff lines and distinctive volcanic formations to navigate the region. They may also have been important for cultural practices, sites of sacred ceremonies and other social gatherings.</p>\n<p><b>A legacy of timber harvesting<br></b>Before it was a national park, Coorabakh had a long history of forestry operations. This was once a centre of intensive logging – particularly during the World Wars – and visitors can still find physical remnants of the industry. One evocative site is the Langley Vale tramway, which was originally used to transport timber 21km from Old North Camp to Langley Vale, first by horse and later by steam engine. The line was abandoned in the 1940s, but relics still remain: timber bridges, elevated platforms, offcuts left to moulder in the forest, reclaimed by nature.</p>\n<p><b>Eighteen forest ecosystems<br></b>The astonishing variety of forest ecosystems in Coorabakh vary from wet foothills covered in blackbutts to subtropical rainforest. This makes a visit a fascinating experience as you range from high lookouts over eucalyptus canopies to cool mossy creekbeds. The park is important at a regional level for a number of rare and significant plant species. There are also several species of threatened animal, including the spotted-tailed quoll, yellow-bellied glider, powerful owl and stuttering frog.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Land of plenty<br></b>This is the traditional lands of the Worimi and Biripi people who lived and moved around the area in response to the seasonal availability of food. Such a broad ecosystem would have provided many resources for medicinal, ceremonial and cultural purposes. It is very likely that people travelling from the coast to Barrington Tops area would have passed through Copeland Tops. Their history will forever be an integral part of this landscape.</p>\n<p><b>Striking it rich<br></b>It was the red cedar cutters who, battling to log ‘red gold’ in this unforgiving terrain from the early 1800s, first discovered gold here in 1875. The area soon became known as Copeland and over the next 60 years more than 50 gold mines were dug in the area. According to the records, over 1800kg of the valuable metal were extracted during that time. Many relics of this mining heritage remain in the form of historic sites and derelict equipment. However, the bushland and rainforest now dominate once again.</p>\n<p><b>From little things big things grow<br></b>From the delicate epiphytes, only one cell in width, to the gnarled sprawling branches of the ancient grey myrtles, each plant has its place within the ecosystem of the rare dry rainforest. The tract within Copeland Tops is the largest accessible section in the district of Gloucester. Take a walk through the green corridors overhung by strangler figs, shatterwood and grey myrtle.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Remnants of Aboriginal heritage<br></b>The name ‘Cottan-Bimbang’ is an Aboriginal word meaning ‘walking stick palm’, referring to a plant which can be found scattered throughout the national park. Echoes of Aboriginal heritage can also be seen in the routes used by early explorers and settlers, which were probably first used by Aboriginal people to travel between the coast and tablelands.</p>\n<p><b>Colonial settlers, gold, and bushrangers<br></b>Cottan-Bimbang has a rich past filled with colonial settlers and convicts. In fact, the first convict road linking Port Macquarie to Walcha went through here; keep an eye out for stonework remnants buried in the undergrowth. The famed explorer John Oxley first travelled through the area in 1818, on his way to the coast. Loggers came not long after in their search for cedar, the ‘red gold.’ Regular gold was sought here too – Cells State Conservation Area, deep in the park, contains relics of early mining. And just to top off a dramatic, event-filled history, the bushranger Jimmy Governer (Jimmy Backsmith) travelled through the area with his brother before being captured closer to Port Macquarie.</p>\n<p><b>A potential World Heritage Area<br></b>Rainforest makes up 40 per cent of Cottan-Bimbang National Park, with subtropical rainforest in the centre around the catchment of Cells Creek, and warm temperate rainforest and dry rainforest of myrtle further out. Because of this diverse ecosystem, Cottan-Bimbang has been nominated for inclusion in the Gondwana Rainforest World Heritage Area.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001037","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Walcha</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6777 4700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 188W North Street, Walcha NSW 2354<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Cottan-Bimbang National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walcha (65km)</li>\n<li>Wauchope (70km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From either Walcha or Wauchope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow Oxley Highway , which leads directly through Cottan-Bimbang National Park.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Cottan-Bimbang National Park.

These include rolling dunes that spring to life with wildflowers and migratory birds that populate the lagoons. There are lots of great lookouts to spot whales from as they migrate along the coast in winter or watch ospreys and falcons circle in the skies. Not to mention, kangaroos, koalas and cockatoos galore. Christmas visitors will receive an extra gift, Crowdy Bay’s famous festive season blooms of Christmas bells.</p>\n<p><strong>Past present</strong><br>\nThe Birpai people have climbed the headlands, swum in the rivers, crossed the sand dunes and walked the beaches of Crowdy Bay National Park for thousands of years. The sea and forest areas were a rich food source for the Birpai people, providing fish, shellfish, wallabies and berries. The park protects a number of Aboriginal sites, like shell middens and campsites, the oldest of which are about 6,000 years old. The park continues to be an important place for local Aboriginal people today.</p>\n<p><strong>Writers's retreat</strong><br>\nDuring World War II, the Australian author Kylie Tennant moved to Laurieton where she met the reclusive Ernie Metcalfe, a farmer who grazed cattle on Diamond Head. Ernie built Kylie a timber slab hut to use as a writer’s retreat. In return, Kylie portrayed Metcalfe and Crowdy Bay in the book <i>The Man on the Headland</i>. Kylie Tennant donated the hut and the surrounding land to Crowdy Bay National Park in 1976. If you’re walking along the Metcalfe walk, stop to have a look inside Kylie’s hut, or you could set up camp at one of the shady campsites at Kylie's Hut walk-in campground.</p>\n<p><strong>Postcard perfect</strong><br>\nThis spectacular environment is truly something to write home about. If you can’t find the words, try these – panoramic, breathtaking, even gobsmacking. Then again, you’ll probably be too busy exploring the tracks, gazing agape at the huge rock arches, communing with wildlife or throwing a line to write lines on a postcard.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Crowdy Bay National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dunbogan (3km)</li>\n<li>Laurieton (3km)</li>\n<li>Harrington (5km)</li>\n<li>North Haven (6km)</li>\n<li>Taree (20km)</li>\n<li>Port Macquarie (30km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Laurieton:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For northern access to the park drive along Diamond Head Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Harrington:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For southern access to the park drive along Crowdy Head Road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>Winter (Jun, Jul, Aug)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember your binoculars and camera to experience the sight of migrating whales</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spring (Sept, Oct, Nov)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wildflowers paint the dunes and heath in spectacular colour during spring</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summer (Dec, Jan, Feb)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swimming, boating and fishing – enjoy the delights of Crowdy Bay’s magnificent beaches</li>\n<li>Look out for the festive Christmas Bell blooms</li>\n</ul>\n","temperature":"\n<p>Summer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 19°C and 25°C</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded temperature in summer is 43.3°C</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winter ­</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 10°C and 19°C</li>\n<li>The area's lowest recorded temperature in winter is -1.7°C</li>\n</ul>\n","rainfall":"\n<ul>\n<li>The wettest months of the year on average are Feburary and March, the driest is September</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded rainfall is 310mm in one day</li>\n</ul>"},"spatial_data":[{"type":"Marker","gid_id":"{B4449024-21F8-46C5-B2A8-8D6967D7ED7E}","spatial_data":"POINT (152.74762417180517 -31.770793741409733)"}],"alerts":[{"title":"Crowdy Bay National Park","description":"\n<strong class=\"closed-areas\">CLOSED AREAS</strong>\n<br/>\nTEST entire park closure all parks in state, now, all PWG regions selected.<br />\n(Ends  Thursday 5 December)<br />\n<strong class=\"fire-ban\">FIRE BAN</strong>\n<br />\nA <a href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/fire/totalfirebans.htm\">park fire ban</a> applies in the park.\n<br />\n"}]},{"ParkURL":"http://nationalparks2.aws.rroom.net/cudgen-nature-reserve","contact_details":{"website":"http://nationalparks2.aws.rroom.net/cudgen-nature-reserve","phone":null,"email":null},"name":"cudgen-nature-reserve","ItemID":"{9A1B4265-FA1F-4CF0-AE9F-BF8C51EA1BF3}","seo":{"meta_title":"Cudgen Nature Reserve","meta_description":"Escape the Tweed Coast crowds and head to Cudgen Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal heritage<br></b>Aboriginal Australians have a long relationship with Culgoa. Murrawarri people, from the Gandugari group, consider it traditional land and it has significant archaeological and cultural value. Other tribal groups include the Ngemba, Ngaampaa, Paakandji, Morawari and Budjiti, who work with the NPWS in discussions of land management. Today, Murrawarri descendants reside in the area around the park, including the townships of Weilmoringle, Brewarrina, Goodooga, Bourke and Enngonia. These people retain a strong oral history of the region, expressed as traditional knowledge, beliefs, personal history and attachment to the landscape.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage<br></b>Charles Sturt was the first European explorer to venture here, in 1829, but colonial pastoralists were not far behind. By the 1860s, settlements were established right across the region, with large properties like Byerawering, Cawwell and Burban Grange, where Culgoa River campground can be found today. Culgoa National Park is committed to conserving the pastoral history of the area.</p>\n<p><b>Animals, great and small<br></b>Culgoa has enough animals to keep even the most knowledgable naturalist glued to their binoculars: 24 mammals, 170 species of bird, 29 lizards, seven types of snake, and 15 types of frog. If you’re lucky, you might spot a long-necked tortoise – there are many varieties in the park. Even more special, Culgoa has one of the largest koala populations in northern NSW.</p>\n<p><b>The shade of a coolabah tree<br></b>Culgoa is the only national park in NSW with Brigalow-gidgee woodland. It also has the largest continuous tract of coolabah woodland left in the state, meaning plenty of opportunities to settle down in the late afternoon to sing a few campfire songs.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001052","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bourke</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6830 0200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 51 Oxley Street, Bourke NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Culgoa National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brewarrina (120km)</li>\n<li>Bourke (180km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Bourke:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One route follows the dirt River Road to Weilmoringle, where you turn left onto Enngonia Road.

Due to its largely undisturbed state, nature enthusiasts, botanists and researchers flock to the area to study this special patch of forest.</p>\n<p><b>Local nightlife<br></b>This remnant forest is an important breeding ground for a range of animals and birdlife that hunt and feed at night.

Having travelled up and down the escarpment along well-worn pathways between the coast and the Monaro Tablelands for thousands of years, there are many places of spiritual significance. Scarred trees, grinding grooves and middens can be seen along the ‘dreaming trails’ of Deua.</p>\n<p><strong>Diverse scenery</strong><br>\nValleys dissected by wild rivers, rugged mountains, deep gorges, dry ridges, steep escarpments, limestone karst and high plateaus – these are some of the diverse landforms at Deua National Park. The Big Hole is thought to have been an underground cave until the ceiling collapsed and now is a 96m deep and 50m wide pit. Marble Arch has a car-sized boulder over its entrance and inside this cave are animal remains believed to be thousands of years old. Bendethera Cave is over 250m long, 320m wide and contains massive limestone formations in caverns with up to 15m high ceilings.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful stuff</strong><br>\nDeua is home to over 106 species of birds. There is a particularly high diversity of birds of prey in the park, such as the powerful owl and the peregrine falcon. The powerful owl is Australia’s largest owl. These owls are nocturnal predators, hunting the park’s gliders, flighted mammals and other nocturnal birds among the trees. The peregrine falcon, which is the fastest creature in the animal kingdom, can reach over 300km/hr in a high-speed dive when hunting. So if you see a dark vertical blur in the sky over Deua, you’ll know now what it is and why it’s moving so fast.</p>\n<p><strong>Luscious landscapes</strong><br>\nFrom grassy woodlands on the lower eastern slopes of Deua Valley, to the peatlands and swamps on the tablelands, there are landscapes aplenty at Deua National Park. Rocky outcrops found throughout the park support unique and rare species of gum trees, like the woila and jilliga ash, whilst the limestone slopes in Bendethera Valley is the only known location of Bendethera wattle; a sight to behold as they blossom during spring. The drier and cooler conditions allow pinkwoods and soft tree ferns to thrive in the higher altitudes of the eastern escarpments, and grey myrtle, lilly pilli and mock olives can regularly be seen along the small creeks and gullies throughout.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Show caves","id":"{C58C2DB9-8AC5-475D-84AD-4CB9F6B411DD}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001023","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Narooma</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4476 0800<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Cnr Graham & Burrawang Sts, Narooma NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Deua National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moruya (35km)</li>\n<li>Braidwood (45km)</li>\n<li>Cooma (55km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Braidwood:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south along Cooma Road for 30 minutes</li>\n<li>Turn left at the sign to Berlang/The Big Hole</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Moruya:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive west along the Araluen Road for 45 minutes until you reach Deua River campgrounds<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Cooma:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive northeast along the Numeralla Road for 70 minutes to Middle Mountain Road and turn right into the park</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Deua National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Dreamtime stories<br></b>The local Aboriginal people tell a Dreamtime story of three brothers in the Birpai tribe who were killed and buried where the mountains stand. The youngest of the three brothers was Dooragan, hence the park’s name. Coincidentally, ‘Three Brothers’ was also a name given to the three mountains by Captain James Cook as he sailed past in 1770, without any knowledge that the local Aboriginal people referred to them in such a similar way.</p>\n<p><b>The lifeblood of Laurieton<br></b>Sixty or so years after Captain Cook passed by, the forests of North Brother Mountain and good access to waterways for easy transport and shipping, meant that timber harvesting contributed to the establishment of the Camden Haven area, and pioneer settlements developed around them.</p>\n<p><b>A choir of birdsong<br></b>While most visitors may see certain species around the lookouts – like cheeky magpies, currawongs and kookaburras – those with an ear for birds will find the forest has a greater diversity than their eyes would have them believe. Occasionally, a lucky birdwatcher may spot the dramatic flash of rainbow colour as a wompoo fruit-dove darts from place to place in search of rainforest fruits. Overhead, resident wedge-tailed eagles demonstrate their clever use of up-drafts, watching for where their next meal might come from.</p>\n<p><b>Soar like an eagle<br></b>Popular for almost 30 years as a hang-gliding site, most park visitors leave launching themselves off the summit to the professionals, and just enjoy watching the awesome spectacle as experienced pilots lift off from and soar around the lookout area.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Dooragan National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Laurieton (1km)</li>\n<li>Port Macquarie (25km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Port Macquarie via Ocean Drive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel south out of Port Macquarie on Ocean Drive for around 33km, following signs via Lake Cathie, Bonny Hills, and then to Laurieton.</li>\n<li>At Laurieton, turn towards Kew and continue on Ocean Drive for around 0.5km.</li>\n<li>Travel 5km up Captain Cook Bicentennial Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Port Macquarie via Pacific Highway:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow Oxley Highway for approximately 9km west to Pacific Highway</li>\n<li>Turn east off Pacific Highway, 22km south at Kew, and follow Ocean Drive east for about 7km.</li>\n<li>Travel 5km up Captain Cook Bicentennial Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Taree via Pacific Highway:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the northern end of the Taree bypass on Pacific Highway, travel north on the highway for around 39km to Kew.</li>\n<li>Turn east off Pacific Highway at Kew and follow Ocean Drive east for about 7km towards Laurieton</li>\n<li>Travel 5km up Captain Cook Bicentennial Road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options to Taree, Laurieton or Port Macquarie, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Dooragan National Park.

The dense forest is the ideal hiding place for reptiles, so you’ll need to be very quiet and patient in order to catch a glimpse. Look for the southern angle-headed dragon clinging to the trunks of trees along the Wonga walk and the pouched frog by the water at Tristania Falls.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001040","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Dorrigo Rainforest Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6657 2309<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Dorrigo Rainforest Centre, Dome Road, Dorrigo NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday, 9:00am-4:30pm weekends, (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Dorrigo National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dorrigo (4km)</li>\n<li>Bellingen (25km)</li>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (60km)</li>\n<li>Armidale (121km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Armidale, drive east along the Waterfall Way for about 90 minutes.

The park is named in respect to their Traditional Owners, and Gumbaynggir People continue to visit the area today for bush foods and medicines. Many features of the land and waterways, as well as local plants and animals, contribute to a rich heritage of dreaming stories and cultural learning that is passed down through generations. Bowra Sugarloaf, for example, the highest peak in the park, holds considerable spiritual significance. The NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service works with local Aboriginal communities to protect this heritage for the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Threatened and endangered animals<br></strong>The steep, often inaccessible terrain means many of the animals that call Dunggir National Park home are difficult to see. But there are a whole range of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, and the park features at least twelves species that are threatened or endangered, including the koala, powerful owl, spaghnum frog, and parma wallaby. Keep your eyes open in case you get lucky, and bring a pair of binoculars for superb birdwatching.

The park’s landscape provided a rich source of food, shelter, medicines and weapons and continues to be an important place for Aboriginal people today. Walk the Bingi Dreaming track to follow the footsteps of the Brinja-Yuin people. Dreaming tracks traditionally linked the places visited by local Aboriginal people, then extended to connect other places utilised by neighbouring clans so that all Aboriginal people in Australia were connected by these unique highways.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b><br>\nThe period from the 1840's to the 1900's saw a rapid development of the area as a result of several often short-lived gold rushes, the growth of more intensive pastoral and agricultural land uses, and the expansion of timber getting activities. Many small towns grew up throughout the area, often acting as transport hubs and points of supply for surrounding districts. South Head at Moruya has many reminders of the important role shipping played, including several breakwaters and training walls that guided shipping through the river mouth, as well as the pilot’s cottage and several smaller buildings situated on the headland.</p>\n<p><b>Birds galore</b><br>\nEurobodalla National Park provides an important habitat for a wide variety of birds, with 131 bird species having been recorded in the park. Estuaries and headlands within the park are important over-wintering areas for migratory birds, including 17 species of waders. In the summer, you may be lucky enough to see little terns nesting on the ground in sand islands, sandpits and dunes. If you do, please take care not to disturb this precious bird. You may also catch a glimpse of a sooty owl roosting in eucalypt forests in deep moist gullies.</p>\n<p><b>Water abounds</b><br>\nEurobodalla National Park contains a range of aquatic environments, including lagoons, lakes, estuaries, sheltered and wild beaches that protect a wide variety of plants and animals. For visitors, these aquatic environments offer a huge range of water-based activities, like waterskiing and boating at Corunna Lake, fishing and swimming around Mullimburra Point, surfing at 1080 Beach and paddling on Brou Lake and around Lake Tuross.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Enduring Aboriginal heritage</b> <br>\nGaagal Wanggaan (South Beach) National Park has tremendous cultural significance for the Gumbaynggirr Aboriginal community of Nambucca Valley, with sites that demonstrate continuous use of the area for thousands of years. Gumbaynggirr People used the lands and waterways for sustenance and ritual practices; they continue to use it today, passing knowledge through generations.</p>\n<p>In recognition of this living heritage, the national park is jointly managed by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and Aboriginal Traditional Owners. Their contribution and knowledge of the area is central to the management of the park and to educating visitors on Aboriginal culture.</p>\n<p><b>An insect paradise<br></b>Making up the bulk of the dry land in the park, sand dunes and dry forests of banksia, blackbutts and scribbly gums encourage a rich undergrowth of shrubs and grasses. Flowers bloom in late winter and early spring, and this attracts a variety of insects and butterflies – including the black grass-dart butterfly which, in larval stage, only feeds on a rare and threatened grass native to Gaagal Wanggaan.</p>\n<p><b>A natural aviary<br></b>With insects and a variety of habitats come birds, and Gaagal Wanggaan (South Beach) National Park has no shortage of different species. White-bellied sea eagles, ospreys, white-faced herons and azure kingfishers flock around Warrell Creek; black-necked storks feed in the wetlands alongside migratory wader birds; and the sand spit at the northern end of the park is of natural significance as a nesting habitat for the endangered little tern. Access to the area is restricted during nesting season, though you may see the terns running along the beach, so bring a camera just in case.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001039","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coffs Harbour</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6652 0900<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 32 Marina Drive, Coffs Harbour NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Gaagal Wanggaan (South Beach) National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nambucca Heads (1km)</li>\n<li>Scotts Head (1km)</li>\n<li>Macksville (6km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Macksville:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive 4km south along Pacific Highway</li>\n<li>Take the turn-off to Scotts Head</li>\n<li>At Scotts Head, follow the directions to the boat ramp at Weir Reserve.</li>\n<li>Continue along South Pacific Drive and South Beach access trail</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Gaagal Wanggaan (South Beach) National Park is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Gaagal Wanggaan (South Beach) National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><strong>Wilderness zone<br></strong>Garawarra State Conservation Area borders Royal National Park and, along with the Nasho, was added to the National Heritage list in 2006. With its close proximity to the ocean and temperate climate, a number of environments flourish in this park, including open heath, eucalypt and subtropical forests. In late winter and early spring, the area comes alive with colour as banksias, Christmas bells and wattles bloom.</p>\n<p><strong>The high life<br></strong>Wildflowers are a huge attraction for the area’s birds and birdwatchers alike. Wattlebirds, known for the ‘wattles’ hanging from their cheeks or throats, are abundant. Listen out for unusual noises while birdwatching; they could be coming from the NSW National Parks emblem – the lyrebird. Common in the reserve, these ground-dwellers mimic sounds, both natural and artificial.</p>\n<p><strong>Activity central<br></strong>Trails throughout Garawarra’s 900ha weave through the bush, down into Hacking River gullies and up to scenic lookouts. These trails connect with other bushwalking trails in neighbouring Royal and Heathcote national parks. If cycling or bushwalking are on the agenda for your retreat into nature, then be sure to take your bicycle and hiking boots with you. Feeling more adventurous?

Visit website for more info","travel_info_description":"\n\t\t<p>A driving tour of Gardens of Stone National Park is a great way to experience the fabulous views and geological formations of this part of the Blue Mountains. Take the old railway route from Lithgow to the Glow Worm Tunnel in Wollemi National Park – you’ll find plenty of places to stop and take photos of the amazing canyons and cliff tops. And if you’re four-wheeling, don’t miss the Baal Bone Gap picnic area off the Castlereagh Highway. Some of the finest rock formations and views can be seen from here.</p>\n<p>If you decide to explore the massive enclosed valley of Capertee along the north and western edges of the park, you can camp at Glen Davis township, or there’s bush camping at Coorongooba over the Wollemi National Park border.</p>","fees":"","opening_times":"<p>Gardens of Stone National Park is always open but may have to close at times due to poor weather or fire danger.</p>","safety_and_supplies_information":"","why_you_should_visit":"\n\t\t<p>Gardens of Stone National Park is a special place, here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Astonishing rock formations</b><br>\nThe geological evolution of this park has produced Triassic Narrabeen sandstone cliffs, slot canyons, grand mesas and the beautiful, yet often strangely delicate, pagodas. These pagodas are formed by wind and rain shaping the Banks Wall and Burramoko sandstone layers that spread right across the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, and they range from quite small to over 60 metres in height. They are amazingly beautiful against the blue mountain sky.</p>\n<br><p><b>Incredible biodiversity</b><br>\nThe Greater Blue Mountains was named a World Heritage Area for its astonishing biodiversity. It contains almost 100 species (or 13%) of eucalypts in the world. This is because of the great diversity of habitats and landscapes in the region. Plateaus, heaths, flat valley floors with varying exposures and fire histories produce the incredible range of plantlife growing in the park.</p>\n<p><b>World-class birdwatching</b><br>\nThe diversity of the park supports a wonderful array of birdlife – this is an internationally-recognised birdwatching area. You may see such threatened birds as the regent honeyeater, swift parrot, spotted harrier, square-tailed kite, turquoise parrot, lyrebird, and many more. Spring and autumn are the times to see the migrations across the sky.</p>\n<br><p><b>The park’s animals</b><br>\nWalkers may also come across rare broad-headed snakes, Lesueur’s gecko, heath monitors, brown antechinus, bush rats and occasional quolls. Brush-tailed rock wallabies can be seen along the caves and ledges, and the upland swamps in the eastern part of the park are home to giant dragonflies.</p>\n<br><p><b>An adventurer’s haven</b><br>\nIf it’s not enough to view the splendour of the park from your car or the picnic area, perhaps canyoning, mountain-biking the Crown Creek Fire Trail, or climbing Pantoneys Crown or Donkey Mountain are more your style. Come well prepared into this remote and sometimes challenging country, or join one of the private tour companies that bring groups into the park.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001004","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Blue Mountains (Blackheath)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4787 8877<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Govetts Leap Road, Blackheath NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9am - 4.30pm, seven days (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Gardens of Stone National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capertee (10km)</li>\n<li>Glen Davis (10km)</li>\n<li>Lithgow (30km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Lithgow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north on the Castlereagh Highway to Ben Bullen</li>\n<li>Turn right for the 4WD road to Baal Bone Gap picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>From Lidsdale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the Wolgan Valley Road towards Newnes.

Explore the park's trails and tracks on horseback, mountain bike or on foot. If you enjoy water activities, launch your canoe or boat from the ramp at Davidson Park or drop a line in one of the great fishing spots throughout the park, like Middle Harbour, where you can catch flathead, flounder, mullet and bream.</p>\n<p><b>Wildlife haven<br></b>Garigal is part of an important wildlife corridor that spans all the way from Sydney Harbour to the national parks of the Blue Mountains. It’s the natural habitat for a number of threatened native animal species, such as tiger quolls, broad-headed snakes and red-crowned toadlets, so keep your eyes peeled. If you see a hole in the ground it may be that of the endangered southern brown bandicoot.</p>\n<p><b>Wartime stories<br></b>There are many places of historical interest in the park, such as Bungaroo and the former Bantry Bay Explosives Magazine complex. Both sites played a key role in the early establishment of Sydney and are important reminders of our history since colonisation.

Living around the range are direct descendants of graziers, lumberers and miners who made their livings here. Bullock teams and horses once struggled through the bush and granite tors, attempting to tame a landscape that today inspires for its wild ruggedness. Evidence of their work can be glimpsed at Mulligans campground, where an aborted hydro-electric scheme from the 1900s is memoralised by a remaining hut and several weirs. Hikers on the wide-reaching Gibraltar-Washpool World Heritage walk might also notice relics of pre-WWII tin and gold-mining operations in the Grassy Creek area.</p>\n<p><b>World Heritage Area<br></b>Part of the Gondwana Rainforests Reserves of Australia, Gibraltar Range is listed on the World Heritage register for rainforest plants that have existed since Australia was part of the Gondwana super-continent. Gibraltar Range National Park is home to several threatened species of animal: the endangered giant barred frog, which can grow to the size of a small adult’s hand; and glossy black cockatoos, under threat from a loss of breeding habitat. Feeding locations are very important to the continuing survival of the cockatoo.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001036","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Glen Innes</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6739 0700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 68 Church Street, Glen Innes NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Gibraltar Range National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Glen Innes (68km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (92km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Glen Innes:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>If travelling along the New England Highway, the park is best accessed via the Gwydir Highway, turning east at the roundabout in the middle of town and follow the signs towards Grafton.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Grafton</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>If travelling via the Pacific Highway, turn west onto the Gwydir Highway in Grafton and follow the signs to Glen Innes.

They favoured the area for the abundance of food, including marine life and bush tucker. The park today contains a number of ancient Aboriginal sites, including campsites, middens and axe grinding grooves. You can find out more about the Aboriginal cultural heritage of this park on an <a title=\"Aboriginal Discovery tour\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/glenrock-state-conservation-area\" target=\"_blank\">Aboriginal Discovery tour</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Back to nature</b><br>\nGlenrock boasts a diverse environment from deep gullies to coastal rainforest, beaches and rocky cliffs. A major feature is Glenrock Lagoon, fed by Flaggy and Little Flaggy creeks to the west. The sandstones in these creeks have resisted erosion, resulting in attractive waterfalls and rockpools for which the area has long been renowned. When you’ve explored the inland, head for the surf at Dudley, Burwood and Glenrock Beaches.</p>\n<p><b>Stride, ride, or glide</b><br>\nGlenrock is magnificent for mountain bike riding, with 14km of single track and 20km of management trails in the northern half of the park. The mountain bike tracks wind through open forest and woodlands and provide access to Burwood Beach, Leichhardt's lookout and the waterfalls. If you prefer to travel on foot, there are excellent walks including the Yuelarbah track, part of the <a title=\"Great North walk\" href=\"http://www.lpma.nsw.gov.au/about_recreation/walking_tracks/great_north_walk\" target=\"_blank\">Great North walk</a> from Sydney to Newcastle. Horseriding is also permitted on some trails. Experienced hang gliders have a choice of two launching pads within the park and will enjoy stunning views of the Newcastle coastline.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20100826115654773","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Newcastle</h3>\n        <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4946 4100</p>\n        \n        <p><strong>Street address:</strong> Hunter Wetland Centre, Sandgate Road, Shortland NSW</p>\n        <p><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am to 4:30pm</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Glenrock State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Newcastle (5km)</li>\n<li>Charlestown (5km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (160km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Newcastle, Charlestown and Sydney, take the Pacific Highway to Highfields or Kahibah in Newcastle.</p>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Glenrock State Conservation Area.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Rich Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>Wiradjuri (Yuradjurray) people lived mostly on the flats east of Herveys Range escarpment and in the central and southern Curumbenya Range. A large range of sites including open camp sites, stone arrangements, quarry and axe grinding grooves can be seern throughout the park. Scarred trees exist near Wanda Wandong campground. Oral stories have been passed down through generations about the mythological importance of these lands, and many parts of the park have been used for Aboriginal ceremonies. Wanda Wandong Woodland walking track includes several informative signs that give insight into the local Aboriginal culture.</p>\n<p><b>Birds aplenty<br></b>Birdwatchers will love Goobang. Many unique species can be seen here; parrots, including the eastern rosellas; little lorikeets; red-rumped parrots; and threatened glossy black cockatoos are all regulars. You may spot wedge-tailed eagles and brown falcons soaring overhead from some of the higher vantage points in the park. The heathlands and shrubs also support many small birds, such as wrens, thornbills, warblers, pardalotes, finches and robins.</p>\n<p><b>Leaf lovers dream<br></b>Over 500 plant species have been recorded in the park, making the vegetation in Goobang National Park part of the largest remaining forest woodland complex in the central western slopes of NSW. The park contains an enormous diversity of vegetation types, including several communities and species which require a particular focus on conservation. Expect to see red ironbark, mugga ironbark, black cypress pine, red stringybark, Blakely’s red gum, yellow box and grey box, shrubby sheaok, heaths, pink five-corners, wattles, mat rush, tea trees, grevilleas, hopbush, as well as a large diversity of native grasses, herbs and forbs that put on a colourful display in spring.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001045","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Forbes </h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6851 4429<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Camp Street, Forbes<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Goobang National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Peak Hill (38km)</li>\n<li>Parkes (55km)</li>\n<li>Dubbo (60km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Dubbo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel 48km south on Newell Highway towards Parkes then turn left onto Gundong Road just before Tomingley, following the signs to Goobang National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal echoes</b><br>\nFor many thousands of years before European settlement, the river valley that runs through Goulburn River National Park was an important trading route between the Aboriginal people who resided on the coast, and those who lived on the western plains. The area was traditionally occupied by the people of the Wiradjuri, Gamileroi and Wonnarua clans, and today more than 300 known Aboriginal sites remain within the park, mainly along the river.</p>\n<p><b>Action aplenty</b><br>\nAlong the Goulburn River, there are plenty of outdoor pursuits to keep you busy. The river is home to lots of natural pools that are suitable for swimming. After rain, the gentle flow of the river makes canoeing and liloing possible. There are lots of walking opportunities in Goulburn River National Park, like Lees Pinch lookout track and old logging trails that are excellent for exploring on foot or on a mountain bike.</p>\n<p><br><b>Importance established</b><br>\nThe park, covering over 70,000ha, was established in 1983 following the decision that the land was precious, both environmentally and culturally, especially for the traditional Aboriginal owners. Visiting the park today, you’ll admire the sheer magnificence of Goulburn River National Park, due to its preservation as a forest landscape, much of which is surrounded by pastoral land.</p>\n<p><b>Wild about the park</b><br>\nWith its location along the river, surrounded by rural holdings, Goulburn River is rich in plant and wildlife. Kangaroos, wallabies and wallaroos are often seen grazing on the riverbanks. A rich variety of plant life – eucalypts, river oak, grevilleas and callistemon (more commonly called bottlebrush) – provides habitats for many birds, including glossy black cockatoos and lyrebirds.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001006","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Mudgee</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6370 9000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 27 Inglis Street, Mudgee NSW 2850<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Thursday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<ul>\n<li>Merriwa (35km)</li>\n<li>Mudgee (50km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (320km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>Goulburn River National Park is accessible from a number of towns in the area.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From Mudgee, follow Wollar Road</li>\n<li>From Merriwa, follow Ringwood Road</li>\n<li>From Denman, go along the Denman to Wollar Road – it follows long stretches of the Goulburn River.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a></p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Goulburn River National Park.

Before it became a national park, the area was home to the Ngemba people, who held ceremonial events in parts of the Gundabooka range. On your visit, you’ll see Aboriginal rock art, with motifs including dancers and animals.</p>\n<p><b>The beautiful outback</b><br>\nGundabooka National Park is located in northwest NSW, approximately 50km southwest of Bourke and 110km northwest of Cobar. The 43,000ha national park extends from the Darling river banks to the Gundabooka range. Vast stretches of grassy woodlands, open plains and rust-coloured rock dominate the landscape.</p>\n<p><b>An emphasis on conservation</b><br>\nA visit to Gundabooka National Park offers the wonderful opportunity to spot some of Australia’s rarest birds and animals. Several threatened species – including the little pied bat, kultarr, pink cockatoo and painted honeyeater – have been recorded in the area. The park also includes 21 different plant communities, including threatened plant species like the curly bark wattle.</p>\n<p><b>Rewarding walks</b><br>\nThere are a number of opportunities to stretch your legs along one of the well-signed walks in Gundabooka National Park. Take the wonderful Mulareenya Creek Art Site track and see fascinating Aboriginal rock art. Climbing the Little Mountain track is also well worth the effort with impressive views awaiting you at the summit. You can go on your own, or <a title=\"take a guided tour\" href=\"http://www.wildwildworld.com.au/WWW/Search/SearchActivity.aspx?Park=20080416100010696&amp;Region=20101022000000110&amp;StartDate=from&amp;EndDate=to&amp;ShowNonDateEvents=False\" target=\"_blank\">take a guided tour</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Pastoral history</b><br>\nThough noted by Charles Sturt in 1829, the Gundabooka range wasn’t used by pastoralists until the late 1800s. The range was included in neighbouring sheep stations which were then subdivided after World War I. Today, three of these smaller stations – Ben Lomond, Belah and Mulgowan – make up Gundabooka National Park. Check out the old homesteads, quarters, fences, tanks, shearing sheds and yards on your visit.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001052","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bourke</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6830 0200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 51 Oxley Street, Bourke NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Gundabooka National Park and State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bourke (50km)</li>\n<li>Cobar (110km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Bourke:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south from Bourke on Kidman Way for approximately 49km and turn right onto Ben Lomond Road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Gundabooka National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Routes of time<br></b>Archaeological sites suggest that Aboriginal people have occupied these valleys for over 10,000 years. The Guy Fawkes and Boyd Rivers once served as important traffic and trade routes linking the tablelands to the coast. Ebor Falls was traditionally named ‘Martiam’, which means ‘Great Falls’ in Gumbaynggir language.</p>\n<p><b>Gold rush<br></b>Major Edward Parke named the Guy Fawkes River after camping nearby on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5, 1845. Gold was discovered in the late 1800s at Ballards Flat and Dalmorton, with the latter once supporting a town of 3,000 people during a short gold rush. A couple of building ruins remain today and old stockmen huts and yards are still present throughout the valleys.</p>\n<p><b>Protected wilderness<br></b>The park is a conservation site for one of the most significant areas of wilderness in northern NSW, extending over 84,000ha of the 107,000ha park. This preserves the biodiversity of the park, allowing its natural ecosystems to be kept free from excessive human impact.</p>\n<p><b>Wild about species<br></b>The park is an incredible biodiversity hotspot. There are over 40 different plant communities and about 1000 plant species in the park, along with 28 threatened plant species, 24 threatened animal species, and significant areas of old growth forest. The endangered brush-tailed rock-wallaby can be seen in the rocky areas of the park, while glossy black cockatoos are often spotted throughout the park.

The sea, rivers and wetlands provided a rich source of food like fish and shellfish and the strong Aboriginal heritage is evident today. The park is culturally important to Aboriginal people as it contains ceremonial grounds, burial sites, shell middens and campsites.</p>\n<p><b>Flutter by butterfly</b> <br>\nYou’re bound to see butterflies fluttering past you in Hat Head National Park. Many types have been spotted in the park, including several types of swallow-tailed butterflies. One type, the regent skipper, is only found in Hat Head National Park and Limeburners Creek National Park.

Keep your eyes peeled for possums, wallabies and, although they’re shy, lyrebirds. Deep gorges worn into the park’s age-old sandstone boast creeks and hidden pools to explore and relax by.</p>\n<p><b>The great outdoors</b><br>\nSlow down and forget your cares with a freshwater swim. Try Kingfisher Pool, Mirang Pool or Lake Eckersley. Or check out the pretty rockpools and waterfalls where Heathcote Creek meets the Woronora River. Cycle along Pipeline Road to the Sarahs Knob picnic area, where you can also complete a great hill run.</p>\n<p><b>A calm haven</b><br>\nThe 2,250ha Heathcote National Park is less than an hour from central Sydney by car or train. The park adjoins Royal National Park, just west of the Princes Highway and South Coast train line. However, once you’re inside you’ll forget about transportation – the park is beautiful, quiet and secluded, plus, it’s a vehicle-free zone.</p>\n<p><b>A long and varied history</b><br>\nThe area was for years home to local Aboriginal people, and you can still see several Aboriginal rock engraving sites. In 1937, a bushwalking group leased a section of what is now national parkland to protect this important area of bush. This section and its surrounds became known as the Heathcote Primitive Area (1943). This was expanded again and renamed Heathcote State Park (1967). In 1974, the area became Heathcote National Park.</p>\n<p><b>A seasoned walker’s park</b><br>\nIf you love to bushwalk, then Heathcote is your kind of park. A multitude of walking tracks criss-cross the park, including the Heathcote to Waterfall track linking Heathcote and Waterfall train stations. This 10km walk starts at either end and can be enjoyed in one day or with an overnight stop at the Mirang Pool campground.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001058","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Royal National Park visitor centre</h3>\n    <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9542 0648<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 2 Lady Carrington Drive, Audley, Royal National Park, NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20080401155936219","contact_details_full":"<h3>Royal National Park office</h3>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9542 0648<br />\n<strong>Street address:</strong> 159 Farnell Avenue, Royal National Park, NSW<br />\n<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:30pm, Monday to Friday (closed public holidays)</p>"}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Heathcote National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sydney (35km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>There is no private vehicle access permitted in Heathcote National Park, which is 35km south of Sydney.</p>\n<p>From Heathcote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On foot, enter the park along any of the walking tracks or from the main fire trail located between Woronora Dam Road and Heathcote Road, along the Water Board pipeline.</li>\n<li>You can also enter from Heathcote via Oliver Street.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Waterfall:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is access at Waterfall from the northern end of Warrabin Street and from the Woronora Dam Road, which leads off the Princes Highway 3.5km south of Waterfall.</li>\n<li>About 2km from the end of the Woronora Dam Road you’ll see a short stretch of unsealed road leading to Sarahs Knob.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n\nBike \n\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle Info website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information</p>","public_transport":"","bike":"","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Heathcote National Park.

Since the Second World War the scarred landscape has drawn artists such as Russell Drysdale, Donald Friend, John Olsen and Brett Whiteley to capture the striking scenery on canvas. The Hill End Artist in Residence Program at the Jean Ballet Gallery continues this tradition with contemporary artists still making the pilgrimage to Hill End. Why not take a walk in the same landscape that has moved so many artists – you might be inspired to create your own piece of art.</p>\n<p><b>A past to cherish<br></b>The gold rush hit nearby Bathurst in 1851 and Hill End, swept up in the frenzy, was settled in 1852. It wasn’t until almost 20 years later, however, that large-scale mining began. After most of the mining population had moved on, it was the Gold Centenary Celebrations in 1951 that were the catalyst for Hill End being recognised for its significant heritage value.</p>\n<p>Hill End has been conserved and restored so it isn’t too difficult to imagine life in the shoes of the town’s past residents. There are some wonderful examples of gold rush-era buildings, with corrugated roofs and lacework verandahs. The original streetscapes are also home to the visitor centre, where you can find a resident specialist genealogist to help you trace your roots.</p>\n<p><b>Mine for gold</b><br>\nEver wondered how gold is separated from the rock it’s found in?

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Feather bluster<br></b>The Hunter River and its estuaries are home to a number of habitats – freshwater wetlands, mangroves and coastal rainforest among them – making the area a haven for birdlife. More than 200 species of birds live here or pass through on their migration. Head to Stockton Sandspit, where shorebirds – plovers, oystercatchers and curlews, to name a few – roost and feed on the mud flats. Along the river foreshore, you’ll also likely see pelicans, spoonbills, black swans and, sweeping over the water searching for fish, sea eagles and swamp harriers.</p>\n<p><b>All-ages adventure<br></b>The action all starts at Riverside Park. Here, you’ll find a picnic area and paths leading off around Ash Island. They’re all flat and wide, so perfect for getting kids on their bikes for some fresh air. Take a walk through the wetlands and identify different species of birds. Head to the deepwater jetty and do some fishing. There’s quite the underwater bounty around here and, whether your spot is the jetty or the river foreshores, you can haul in flathead, whiting, tailor and bream.</p>\n<p><b>Early evidence<br></b>Get a taste of some of the area’s history. From the picnic area at Riverside Park, you can walk through the Kooragang City Farm precinct and find the ruins of the farmhouse and dairy built by William Milham, who ran a property here with the first European owner of Ash Island, AW Scott. Also on the island is a heritage-listed World War II radar ‘igloo’.</p>\n<p><b>World-class wetlands<br></b>Hunter Wetlands National Park makes up part of the Hunter Estuary Wetlands Ramsar site (the Ramsar convention recognises wetlands of international importance). This peaceful area is important for many species of birds, including 45 that migrate internationally. The green and golden bell frogs, both threatened species, breed in the freshwater lagoons. The mangroves here also provide maternity roosts for tiny bats, including the eastern free-tail bat.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20100826115654773","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Newcastle</h3>\n        <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4946 4100</p>\n        \n        <p><strong>Street address:</strong> Hunter Wetland Centre, Sandgate Road, Shortland NSW</p>\n        <p><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am to 4:30pm</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Hunter Wetlands National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Newcastle (12km)</li>\n<li>Gosford (90km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (150km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Newcastle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive north along the Pacific Highway towards Hexham</li>\n<li>Just before Hexham McDonalds (on the left at the lights), turn right across the Ash Island Bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit <a title=\"NSW Transport – Newcastle Buses and Ferries\" href=\"http://www.newcastlebuses.info/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW Transport – Newcastle Buses and Ferries</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Hunter Wetlands National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>How it all began<br></b>The Illawarra Escarpment lands were occupied by the Wodi Wodi Aboriginal people for 20,000 years. As such, they are a source of cultural legends and of continuing spiritual significance: Mount Kembla and Mount Keira, for example, feature in a number of creation stories. The conversation area also contains traditional routes of travel between the coastal plain and the plateau.</p>\n<p><b>Our colonial past<br></b>The Illawarra Escarpment area is full of important local heritage, including colonial roads like the ones constructed by Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell around 1834. Some were even built by convicts. Keep your eyes open for buildings, portals, rail tracks and other features from former farming and coal mining.</p>\n<p><b>Going bush<br></b>The Illawarra Escarpment contains the most extensive area of rainforest in the Sydney basin and forms a crucial corridor between Royal National Park and the South Coast. The area acts as an important refuge for species that are affected by environmental disturbances such as development and bushfires. There are currently 12 threatened animal species in the area. You might even spot a lyrebird, the wildlife emblem of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p>\n<p><b>200 million years and counting<br></b>The 500-metre-high Illawarra Escarpment provides a dramatic backdrop to the city of Wollongong and spans 200 million years of geological history.

And if you head towards the sand and mud flats of the nearby Clarence River, there’s another 85 species to spot.</p>\n<p><b>On the water<br></b>Nestled between the coastline and the Clarence River to its south and west, Iluka Nature Reserve has something to offer everyone who enjoys the water. Find a spot to throw in your fishing line from the beaches or rocky coastline, or indulge in a relaxed stroll along the river bank for the estuary fishers. And for those who want to immerse themselves in the glistening blue waters, there’s great swimming, surfing and snorkelling at the beaches near Iluka Bluff.</p>\n<p><b>Whale watching<br></b>As the whales migrate north along the coastline in winter, you couldn’t find a better spot than the lookout at Iluka Bluff to watch the ocean for its wonderful inhabitants. Pack a picnic, take in the stunning panoramic views, and expect to see a whale or two frolicking in the distance.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001038","contact_details_full":"<h3>Grafton</h3>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6641 1500<br />\n<strong>Fax:</strong> 02 6641 1599<br />\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br />\n<strong>Street address:</strong> Level 4, 49 Victoria Street, Grafton NSW<br />\n<strong>Postal address:</strong> PO Box 361, Grafton NSW 2460<br />\n<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>"}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Iluka Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iluka (adjacent)</li>\n<li>Yamba ferry (1km)</li>\n<li>Yamba road (45km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (80km)</li>\n<li>Ballina (95km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Grafton</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive north on the Pacific Highway for approximately 45 minutes</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Iluka Road and drive approximately 15 minutes to Iluka township</li>\n<li>Iluka Nature Reserve can be reached via Iluka village from Long Street or the Iluka Bluff picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Ballina</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south on the Pacific Highway for approximately 60 minutes</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Iluka Road and drive approximately 15 minutes to Iluka township</li>\n<li>Iluka Nature Reserve can be reached via Iluka village from Long Street or the Iluka Bluff picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW transport info website\" href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW transport info website</a> / <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a></p>\n<p>For information on Yamba-Iluka ferry times, visit <a title=\"Clarence River Ferries\" href=\"http://www.clarenceriverferries.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Clarence River Ferries</a></p>","bike":"","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Iluka Nature Reserve.

The World Heritage listing recognises the geographic, botanic and cultural values of the area. The forests of the <a title=\"Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area\" href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/protectedareas/GreaterBlueMountainsWorldHeritageArea.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area</a> have been described as a natural laboratory for the evolution of eucalypts; and more than 90 different eucalypt species occur here – some 13 per cent of all eucalypt species in the world. They grow in a great variety of communities, from tall closed forests, through open forests and woodlands, to the stunted mallee shrublands on the plateaus.<br><br><b>Binomil</b><br>\nThe beautiful and mysterious Jenolan Caves holds special significance to the Gundungurra people who knew it as ‘Binoomea’ meaning ‘dark places’. According to Gundungurra Elder, Old Jimmy Lynch, Aboriginal people knew the caves, carrying sick people as far as the subterranean water which they believed to have great curative powers. The Dreamtime myth of Gurrangatch relates to the forming of Wombeyan and Jenolan Caves. The caves are said to have been formed during a contest between Gurrangatch, a mythical being that was part fish and part reptile, and Mirragan, a legendary tiger cat.<br><br><b>Historic tourism</b><br>\nJenolan Caves is one of Australia’s first tourist attractions; with land having first been set aside for public recreation and enjoyment in 1866. In the years following this, a number of buildings were constructed, the most notable being Caves House; an excellent example of early Victorian architecture and comfortable heritage accommodation. Innovations in engineering and cave lighting are evident – particularly in Chifley Cave. There are more than 300 caves within the Reserve, all containing a range of geological features and formations, like stalactites and stalagmites, plus rarer helicitites and stromaltilites.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>The Dharawal connection<br></b>The Dharawal people have a longstanding association with this land, including important trade and cultural links to other groups in neighbouring areas. Today, the landscape, plants, animals and physical features within the landscape all form an integral part of the cultural heritage of the local Aboriginal people. Several Aboriginal sites have been recorded in the park, including campsites, a scarred tree with an ancient axe grinding groove, and a rock shelter.</p>\n<p><b>Colourful, varied vegetation<br></b>Within Jerrawangala National Park, there are seven different types of unique and distinctive vegetation, including several significant and threatened species such as the ettrema mallee, the albatross mallee and Bauer’s midge orchid. Several regionally rare orchid species also thrive in the park, including a new species of leek orchid.</p>\n<p><b>Walk with the animals<br></b>Animal-lovers will find plenty to observe at Jerrawangala, while wildlife photographers can have a literal field day here. The park’s wildlife statistics are pretty impressive: 19 mammal species, 57 bird species, 23 types of reptiles, and 14 different amphibians. Among the threatened species you may spot here are eastern pygmy possums, grey-headed flying foxes, gang-gang cockatoos, sooty owls, and giant burrowing and heath frogs.</p>\n<p><b>Diverse geology and landscape<br></b>Jerrawangala National Park is a pristine long, narrow parcel of land located along the Turpentine Range, which is part of the Great Eastern Escarpment. The park protects a range of vital landscapes, including flat plateau country, sandstone cliffs, scree slopes and gently sloping coastal hinterland.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001190","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nowra</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4423 2170<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 55 Graham Street, Nowra NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<ul>\n<li>Nowra (22km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Nowra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Albatross Road until you can see HMAS Albatross</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Braidwood Road</li>\n<li>Once you meet Turpentine Road, the park adjoins Braidwood Road, mainly along the road’s eastern side.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Jerrawangala National Park is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Jerrawangala National Park.

Parts of the park border St Georges Basin, Booderee National Park and the exquisite Jervis Bay Marine Park.</p>\n<p>At 4,854ha, the park is comparatively small, but captivating in its natural beauty. You can easily spend a day at one of its beaches alone, so it’s best to allow at least a couple of days to explore the park. There’s no camping in the park, but Jervis Bay accommodation is plentiful and there is camping available at nearby <a title=\"Booderee National Park\" href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/booderee\" target=\"_blank\">Booderee National Park</a>.</p>","fees":"","opening_times":"<p>Jervis Bay National Park is always open but may have to close at times due to poor weather or fire danger.</p>","safety_and_supplies_information":"","why_you_should_visit":"\n\t\t<p>Jervis Bay National Park is a special place, here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ancient connections</b><br>\nJervis Bay sits within the lands of the South Coast (Yuin) Aboriginal people of the Dharawal-Dhurga language group. Research shows the area has the highest density and most diverse range of archaeological site types anywhere on the south coast, making this precious park an important place for the preservation of Aboriginal sites, like coastal middens, stone artefacts, rock art, and axe grinding grooves.</p>\n<p><b>Picture-perfect beaches</b><br>\nArriving in this pristine haven, you could be forgiven for thinking you’re in paradise. The region’s crystal clear waters and impossibly white sand are among its biggest drawcards – the sea is ideal for fishing, swimming and snorkelling. And be sure to enjoy a wander along Hyams Beach to experience its icing-sugar sand – it’s said to be the world’s whitest.</p>\n<p><b>Diverse habitats</b><br>\nA walk through the park reveals its varied vegetation – from endangered bangalay sand forests to ubiquitous eucalypt woodlands. In the park’s protected gullies you’ll spot rainforest species like lilly pilly and water vine. And if you stop by Carama Inlet or Moona Moona creek, you’ll see saltmarsh and mangroves. Be ready to spot plenty of wildlife among coastal heathland on the sandstone plateau near Vincentia, as well as unique flora in the park’s northern clay-soiled heath.</p>\n<p><strong>Protected birds</strong><br>\nThis gorgeous landscape is home to several threatened bird species that depend on the park for survival. The chance of seeing these special birds thriving makes the park a must for everyone, not just birdwatchers. Head to Lake Wollumboola to see waders and water birds or visit the heathland areas, which support eastern bristlebirds and ground parrots.

Here are a few to begin with:</p>\n<p><b>An oasis within a city</b><br>\nKamay Botany Bay National Park covers 492ha of the northern and southern headlands at the entrance to Botany Bay. Located within the Sydney metropolitan area, this stunning park’s coastal location adjoins Crowea Bay – an important habitat for many marine species, including shellfish and octopus.</p>\n<p><b>Historically significant</b><br>\nKurnell is Captain Cook’s landing site and the point of first contact between Aboriginal people and the <i>Endeavour</i> crew<i>.</i> This Sydney park is rich in both Aboriginal and European history. Over 30 Aboriginal sites have been recorded, including rock art and engravings, alongside cobblestone roads and a WWII bunker. Explore this history on the Burrawang walk. It tells the story of the meeting of cultures and takes you on a journey into the past.</p>\n<p><b>See Sydney as it once was</b><br>\nSpectacular views on the Burrawang walk help you imagine how the area looked when the <em>Endeavour</em> arrived. Much of the park’s unspoilt flora gives an idea of the plants that were present pre-1770. A conservation effort to protect and rehabilitate rare and threatened species and ecosystems is underway to preserve this heritage-listed Sydney park.</p>\n<p><b>A wildlife wonderland</b><br>\nMany native plants were first collected and described by Captain Cook’s botanists, Banks and Solander, in what is now national parkland. Over 160 native bird species have been recorded, including the threatened powerful owl, while native animals in the park include echidnas, possums and the threatened tinkling froglet.</p>\n<p><b>So much to do</b><br>\nThe park offers a real escape just minutes from the city. Take a daytrip to go bushwalking, whale watching or fishing. Pick up some information at the Laperouse Museum or the Kurnell Visitor Centre. Discover the foreshore monuments on the Burrawang walk at Kurnell, or tour Bare Island and see the fort built to protect Sydney from enemy attack.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001017","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Kurnell (Kamay Botany Bay National Park)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9668 2000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Kamay Botany Bay National Park, Cape Solander Drive, Kurnell NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:30 am to 4:30 pm 7 days; closed Christmas Day</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001057","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>La Perouse Museum (Botany Bay National Park)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9311 3379<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Botany Bay National Park (North), Cable Station, Anzac Parade, La Perouse NSW 2036<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Sundays only 10:00am-4:00pm.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Amazing formations<br></b>There was a time when Kanangra-Boyd was in danger from logging and the extraction of lime. That all changed after a five-year conservation effort resulted in it being declared part of Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area in 1972. These days, you can see many of the unique formations that were preserved, including Thurat Spires, Kanangra Walls, Mount Colong, and three waterfall systems - Kalang, Kanangara and Morong. The park also features a series of karst landforms ­that can be explored by those with caving experience.</p>\n<p><b>Wonderful wilderness<br></b>High plateaus and sheltered slopes mean Kanangra-Boyd has a diverse range of plantlife, some of it unique to the national park. Heath and mallee dominate the areas exposed to wind and weather, while tall snow gum forests can also be found in the park. Look for the yellow Kanangra wattle that grows only on the rivers – it flowers from early spring to late winter. The wildlife population is extensive too. Keep your eyes peeled for red-necked wallabies, which thrive in this area. Honeyeaters, wrens and fruit-eating pigeons are just some of the 195 species of birds that can be spotted in the park on a daily basis.</p>\n<p><b>Action adventure<br></b>Hardcore hiker? Mad for mountain biking? There’s something for whatever level of adventure you desire. Fire trails that wind throughout the park can be explored by 4WD or bicycle. For those who are handy with a map and compass, there’s plenty of opportunity for self-reliant bushwalking. There are also marked trails that take in the captivating landscape which are even suitable for the kids. You might even want to throw in a line at Kowmung River to see if you can hook a trout.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001005","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Oberon</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6336 1972<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 38 Ross Street, Oberon NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9.00am - 4.30pm, Monday to Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001004","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Blue Mountains (Blackheath)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4787 8877<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Govetts Leap Road, Blackheath NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9am - 4.30pm, seven days (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Kanangra Boyd National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oberon (24km)</li>\n<li>Katoomba (96km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (180km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Oberon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off the main street onto Ross Street at the National Australia Bank, then follow the signs to Jenolan Caves and Kanangra-Boyd National Park.</li>\n<li>A pleasant 25-minute drive will take you to the park entrance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Katoomba:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head west along the Great Western Highway through Mount Victoria and Hartley</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Jenolan Caves Road.</li>\n<li>Continue all the way through Jenolan Caves and 3km later you will come to the main park entrance</li>\n<li>Northern sections of the park can be accessed from Jenolan Caves Road via Mini Mini Fire Trail or Black Range Trail, both of which are between Hampton and Jenolan Caves.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>The main section of Kanangra-Boyd is not accessible by public transport.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ancient connections<br></b>Karuah Nature Reserve is part of the traditional lands of the Worimi Nation. Before European settlement, the Worimi people lived in an area from Port Stephens to Forster and as far west as Gloucester. There are a number of recorded Aboriginal sites in the reserve, particularly along Karuah River , such as modified trees, artefacts, earth mounds, shell middens and a burial site. The Worimi people continue to have a strong connection with the animals, land and waterways of Karuah.</p>\n<p><b>Historical sites<br></b>As well as being a place of natural beauty and tranquillity, Karuah has many historic sites to remind you of the forestry industry that once thrived in this region. Driving through the forest, you’ll be driving along a road network built by the timber industry and see timber loading ramps on the banks of the river at Double Wharf.  Other historic sites to discover are a set of yards at Witt Road and the Hunter Jetty on Claybank Road.</p>\n<p><b>Colourful creatures<br></b>Karuah is home to plenty of native animals. You’ll most likely share your camping spot with locals like bandicoots and ring-tailed and brush-tailed possums. There’s also a local koala population at Karuah, so keep your eyes peeled when you’re walking through the eucalypt forest.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatching retreat<br></b>You’ll find an abundance of birdlife to watch at Karuah. Vulnerable species such as the square-tailed kite, swift parrot and masked owl find their home in eucalyptus woodlands. Glossy black cockatoos can be seen feeding on the casuarina stands along the river’s edge. You might also see one of the eight vulnerable bat species found here, including little bent-wing bats and greater broad-nosed bats.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001031","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nelson Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4984 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 1, 12B Teramby Road, Nelson Bay NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Karuah Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Karuah (20km)</li>\n<li>Raymond Terrace (30km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (55km)</li>\n<li>Maitland (55km)</li>\n<li>Nelson Bay (60km)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Raymond Terrace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north on Pacific Highway</li>\n<li>After approximately 17km, turn left onto Bucketts Way.</li>\n<li>Continue for approximately 9km then turn right onto Hobarts Road, just past Limeburners Creek.</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"","public_transport":"\n<p>Karuah Nature Reserve is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Karuah Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b><br>\nThe name ‘Kattang’ comes from the local language of the Birpai Aboriginal people. Shell middens provide evidence of Aboriginal occupation for thousands of years. The landscape and wildlife of Kattang continue to be an important part of the identity, spirituality and cultural heritage of the Birpai people.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b><br>\nCamden Head Pilot Station, right next to the reserve, is heritage listed as a relic of an era when ships wishing to enter the estuary had to wait, sometimes for days at a time, for the pilot to signal their safe passage. Today the Pilot Station’s role is to contribute to community well being and enhance cultural and natural heritage. They also have holiday accommodation so check out their <a title=\"website\" href=\"http://www.camdenheadpilotstation.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> and get involved.</p>\n<p><b>Plants as a life source<br></b>This small nature reserve supports a variety of habitats, including rugged and exposed headlands, patches of littoral rainforest, dry eucalypt forest and wet and dry heaths. The black she-oaks here are an important food source for the glossy black cockatoo and the wildflowers on the heath attract feeding birds, insects and mammals with their sweet nectar. Why not join the Friends of Kattang to get involved in protecting this precious bushland?</p>\n<p><b>Fascinating animals</b><br>\nWhether you’re exploring the rock platforms or wandering across the cliff tops, you’re sure to see lots of wildlife at Kattang. There are 154 types of animals recorded in this reserve: eight amphibians; six reptiles; 17 mammals; and 123 birds. The cliff tops provide an excellent vantage point for whale watching and spotting dolphins. You might also see northern brown bandicoots, koalas and goannas on walking tracks. Washhouse Beach is one of the most diverse rock platforms in NSW, with some 128 species of organisms living there.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatcher’s haven<br></b>There are 123 bird species seen here, so you’ll see plenty of birdlife all year round. Osprey, white-breasted sea eagle and brahminy kites soar overhead. Spring wildflowers attract flocks of Lewin’s honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater and yellow-faced honeyeater. You might also see migratory birds like the black-faced monarch, dollarbird and rainbow bee-eater in spring and summer. And, of course, if you’re lucky, you might see the threatened wompoo fruit-dove or glossy black cockatoo.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Kattang Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Laurieton (7km)</li>\n<li>Port Macquarie (47km)</li>\n<li>Taree (67km)</li>\n<li>Forster (92km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Port Macquarie:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south on Pacific Highway to Kew</li>\n<li>Turn left into Ocean Drive and continue driving through Laurieton</li>\n<li>After crossing Dunbogan Bridge, turn left onto The Boulevard, which then becomes Camden Head Road.</li>\n<li>Continue for approximately 4km until you reach the reserve</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Taree:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive north on Pacific Highway and take the exit to Kew</li>\n<li>Turn left into Ocean Drive and continue driving through Laurieton</li>\n<li>After crossing Dunbogan Bridge, turn left onto The Boulevard, which then becomes Camden Head Road.</li>\n<li>Continue for approximately 4km until you reach the reserve</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Kattang Nature Reserve is accessible by bus from Port Macquarie.

These river people caught fish by spearing from a canoe or while diving and used nets and fish traps made from baskets. Artefacts and special sites in the area date back an incredible 35,000 years. Many of the staff at Kinchega are of Aboriginal descent and can provide a wealth of information and knowledge about the area.

When it empties, the land is a beautiful bright green. In spring you’ll see vibrant splashes of purple as the Darling river pea begins to flower. Sitting outside your tent just before nightfall is a special time - the sunsets at Kinchega are out of this world.</p>\n<p><b>Life in all its splendour</b><br>\nLace monitors patrol the banks when it’s warm, the Peron’s tree frog sends out a call like laughter in the night and flocks of pink and black cockatoos use tree hollows to nest. Remember not to collect firewood - fallen timber is the home of the kultarr, a small, mouse-sized marsupial with large ears, long delicate legs and a thin tail tipped with a dark tuft.</p>\n<p><b>Pastoral heritage</b><br>\nEncounter Australia’s pastoral history at the classic, colonial historic Kinchega Woolshed and Old Kinchega Homestead, and learn of the trials and tribulations of early settlers. Kinchega is the location where Burke and Wills picked up William Wright, manager of Kinchega Station.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ancient cultures<br></b>Kings Plain National Park is part of the traditional land of the Ngarrabul Aboriginal people, whose tribal totem is the koala, which they call ‘boor-bee’. An Aboriginal person’s totem is an animal or plant with a powerful spiritual connection and is never killed or eaten by that person, since it could be an ancestor. For thousands of years, this tradition has ensured koalas were conserved in this area.</p>\n<p><b>Recent history<br></b>When he rode through the region in 1827, explorer and botanist Allan Cunningham found the first European settlers working the land. Kings Plain National Park was once part of the vast King Plains Station, established in 1838, and for many years an important cattle-grazing property. Today, you can still find evidence of early grazing and mining activity throughout the park, including the remains of huts, mining pits and mullock heaps.</p>\n<p><b>Forests and flowers<br></b>Stands of ironbark, cypress pine and yellow box all feature in the open woodland of Kings Plain National Park. There’s even a rare patch of McKie’s stringybark, a tall tree that flowers white between March and May. You’ll also find uncommon and rare plant species ­– the grey guinea flower and the yellow-flowering Kings Plain homoranthus – in the park’s heath areas. Wildflowers are at their best during spring.</p>\n<p><b>All creatures, great and small<br></b>Wildlife is abundant in the park, and most easily spotted at dawn or dusk. Keep your eyes peeled for eastern grey kangaroos, wallaroos, swamp wallabies, red-neck wallabies and koalas. The shy platypus also lives along the creek. The park is home to more than 80 species of birds, from beautiful king parrots and yellow-tailed black cockatoos to wedge-tailed eagles and the rare peregrine falcon. Near the rivers, look for cormorants, tall white-faced herons and azure kingfishers.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001036","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Glen Innes</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6739 0700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 68 Church Street, Glen Innes NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Kings Plain National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inverell (48km)</li>\n<li>Glen Innes (50km)</li>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (290km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (620km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Glen Innes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the signs from Glen Innes (off Gwydir Highway west of town).</li>\n<li>Following the signs, turn right onto Kings Plain Road.

It offers incredibly varied landscapes of glacial lakes, alpine herb fields, spectacular caves and limestone gorges, the magnificent Snowy River and vast tracts of wilderness.</p>\n<p><b>So much to do</b><br>\nSkiers and snowboarders will be familiar with the fabulous resorts of Thredbo and Perisher, but there are endless activities in Kosciuszko year round. If you’re an adrenalin junky there is rock climbing and abseiling at Blue Waterholes, Clarkes Gorge, the Blowering clifflines and the cirque wall at Blue Lake - where you can even go ice climbing. Not to mention horse riding, boating, fishing, canoeing, swimming, mountain biking, camping, bushwalking, picnicking and four-wheel driving. Plan your trip well and plan to return - you will never run out of things to do in Kosciuszko.</p>\n<p><b>Views forever</b><br>\nClimb Mount Kosciuszko on a clear blue mountain day, enjoy the spectacular western fall of the Main Range from Scammell's Lookout, gaze across the Bogong Peaks Wilderness Area, marvel at the waterfalls, take in the spectacular 360 degree views from Big Talbingo Mountain and don’t miss the beautiful limestone cliffs at Blue Waterholes. Kosciuszko is heaven for photographers.</p>\n<p><b>Life in all its splendour</b><br>\nIn recognition of Kosciuszko’s unique value as a conservation area, it has been named a <a title=\"UNESCO Biosphere Reserve\" href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/biosphere\" target=\"_blank\">UNESCO Biosphere Reserve</a>. More than half the area of the park, over 350,000 hectares, has been declared wilderness and includes the Byadbo, Pilot, Jagungal, Western Fall, Indi, Bogong Peaks, Goobarragandra, Bramina and Bimberi wilderness areas. It also contains Blue Lake, a rare cirque lake, formed by the head of a glacier. The park’s alpine and sub-alpine areas are home to rare plant species found nowhere else in the world, and form the habitat for the rare mountain pygmy possum and corroboree frog.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal

Hire paddle boats from Bobbin Inn, walk the Gibberagong track, horse ride the Perimeter trail or cycle from Mt Colah to Pymble station.</p>\n<p><b>A rich Aboriginal heritage</b><br>\nThe Guringai Aboriginal people originally inhabited the area, and the park showcases their rich cultural heritage. Take the Aboriginal Heritage walk or visit The Basin Aboriginal art site. See Red Hands Cave, rock engravings on Lambert Peninsula or middens near Bobbin Head or join an Aboriginal Discovery tour for a more in-depth experience.</p>\n<p><b>Brilliant for birdwatchers</b><br>\nOver 160 bird species have been recorded in the park so bring those binoculars to see wood ducks, crimson rosellas, wedge-tailed eagles and pelicans.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b><br>\nKwiambal takes its name from the aboriginal people of the Ashford district. Rich in food, water and materials, the area provided a year-round living environment for their ancestors, with sacred sites and hunting grounds spread throughout the park.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b><br>\nThe flat areas of the park have been subjected to farming of tobacco, giving way to cereal crops and the mining of various minerals and sapphires. Unsurprisingly then, there are a number of historical landmarks within the park, including tobacco-drying sheds, woolsheds, fruit trees, storage sheds, and the remains of a house. History enthusiasts will want to seek these out on a visit.</p>\n<p><b>Flowers</b><br>\nKwiambal contains 15 per cent of the native dry rainforest left in NSW. The vegetation is dominated by white cypress pines, silver-leaved ironbarks, and tumbledown gums. Unfortunately, much of the planning area has been subjected to logging in the past, though considerable regeneration makes it a worthy destination for nature-lovers. There are five rare or threatened species in the park: severn wattle, Rodd’s star hair, caustic vine, daisy bush and toadflax. Feel free to look, but please be careful not to damage the plants. In the warmer months of September to March, the wildflowers bloom throughout the bush.</p>\n<p><b>Animals</b><br>\nLike its flowers, Kwiambal is home to dozens of notable animal species, including 32 types of reptile, 11 frogs, and 30 species of mammal.

Here are just some of the reasons why:<br><br><b>Early settlement history<br></b>Lake Innes Ruins is the remains of the elaborate estate built in the 1830s-40s by Major Archibald Clunes Innes, an entrepreneur and important figure in the settlement of Port Macquarie. Innes was convinced that Port Macquarie would become the main gateway to the coastal area around the Hastings River and to nearby New England, so the extensive complex was an ambitious creation by one of the most influential of the early European settlers in the area. Sadly, the Depression of the 1840s bought Innes to near insolvency and forced him to flee the estate. Today, its ruins serve as an educational reminder of the area’s early settlement history.<br><br><b>Colourful wildflowers<br></b>The reserve contains extensive wetlands, including the Innes Swamp, which supports a number of sedges and rushes. On the edges of Lake Innes lie swaths of endangered salt marsh and on the eastern edge of the reserve, you can see the Christmas Bell Plains – a mosaic of coastal heath and swamp that are gorgeous when in bloom in summertime.</p>\n<p><b>Fascinating wildlife<br></b>Numerous local birds and wildlife call the reserve home. On your visit to the park, you’re likely to spot, koalas, kangaroos, possums and gliders, as well as various reptiles and amphibians. Among the birds you might spot on or around the lake are ospreys, ducks and black swans, so be sure to have your binoculars handy for a spot of birdwatching.</p>\n<p><b>Get active<br></b>Lake Innes Nature Reserve provides opportunities for a number of fun recreational activities both on the land and lake. Enjoy fishing, swimming and kayaking in Lake Innes via Perch Hole picnic area. Go bushwalking and birdwatching on the fire trails that run along the Christmas Bell Plains. Or, take a guided tour of the historic Innes Ruins and learn about Port Macquarie’s early history. </p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Lake Innes Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Port Macquarie (&lt;5km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Port Macquarie CBD:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south on Horton Street then west on Gordon Street.

The Awabakal Aboriginal people were the original inhabitants, enjoying plant foods such as cabbage palm and lillypilly, and shellfish like pipis, cockles, mussels, whelks, and oysters collected from rock platforms, the lake’s foreshore, and beaches. Local people caught fish with lines or spears, or trapped them in weirs built at the entrance of tidal channels. The beautiful Pulbah Island is considered sacred by the Awabakal people.</p>\n<p><b>Holidaying history<br></b>The special atmosphere of Lake Macquarie has long drawn holidaymakers. A ferry service between Wangi Wangi Point and Toronto led to a growth in tourism in the 1910s and 1920s, and a number of swimming enclosures and guesthouses catered for the area’s many visitors. Miners came to Wangi Wangi Point from the Cessnock coalfields, and it became a tent city during December and January when the mines closed for Christmas. You can still stay at Wangi Wangi Point in the Tourist Park.</p>\n<p><b>Wonderful wildlife, diverse habitats<br></b>The animals love it here too, making their home among the diverse habitats. Green sea turtles, dolphins, sugar and squirrel gliders, and kangaroos all call the park their home. If you look up, you’ll find sea eagles, kookaburras, lorikeets, and the threatened pied oystercatcher in the trees and sky above the lake. On bushwalks, look out for lovely orchids, spectacular wattles, and coastal banksia.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001016","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Lake Munmorah</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4972 9000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Blue Wren Drive, Munmorah State Conservation Area<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Lake Macquarie State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Swansea (14km)</li>\n<li>Gosford (45km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (55km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (115km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>For Morisset Park, Myuna Bay and Wangi Wangi:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the F3 motorway south from Newcastle or north from Sydney and the Central Coast, and take the Morisset/Mandalong Road exit.</li>\n<li>For Morisset Park, turn right at Fishery Point Road and continue along the road as it becomes Morisset Park Road until you reach Lake Macquarie State Conservation Area.</li>\n<li>For Myuna Bay and Wangi Wangi<b>,</b> take Mandalong Road through Morisset as it becomes Dora Street, then Macquarie Street.

With opportunities for bushwalking and biking, kayaking and boating, picnicking and playing, you're guaranteed to want to visit again and again and it’s so close that you can. Did you know you can even go camping at Lane Cove National Park? For bush camping in an urban environment, head to <a title=\"Lane Cove River Tourist Park\" href=\"http://www.lcrtp.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Lane Cove River Tourist Park</a> on the south western side of the park.</p>\n<p><b>Native plants and animals</b><br>\nThe landscape of Lane Cove National Park is remarkable given that it sits within a large urban environment. You’ll see eucalypt forests, grassy woodland and saltwater wetlands, each of which is home to a range of different plants, animals and birds. Echidnas are mainly nocturnal, but sometimes venture out during the day when the weather is mild – you’ll have to be quick and quiet to catch a glimpse though, the slightest noise will have them curling up into a ball for protection and camouflage. If you’re walking along the river and you think you’ve spied something that looks a little unusual, it could very well be an eastern water dragon ­– look for its distinctive black stripes and crest of enlarged spiny scales along its body.</p>\n<p><b>Connection to Country</b><br>\nLane Cove National Park is part of the traditional land of the Guringai people whose Country extended from around Newcastle to Sydney Harbour. The Guringai people lived primarily by the water; fishing and hunting in the waters and hinterlands and harvesting food from surrounding bushland. The park protects a number of ancient Aboriginal sites today, some of which you may notice while exploring the park.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001008","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Chatswood</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 8448 0400<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Lane.Cove@environment.nsw.gov.au\">Lane.Cove@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Lane Cove National Park, Lady Game Drive, Chatswood NSW 2067</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001055","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Sydney North  (Bobbin Inn, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9472 8949<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bobbin.head@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bobbin.head@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Bobbin Head Road, Mount Colah<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 10am-4pm daily or 9am-4pm during summer school holidays, closed 12:00pm-12:30pm (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20081120105057454","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Lane Cove Bushcare</h3>\n        <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9415 3998 (office) or 0419 753 806 (mobile)</p>\n        <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:lanecove.bushcare@environment.nsw.gov.au\">lanecove.bushcare@environment.nsw.gov.au</a></p>\n        \n        \n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001187","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Sydney Wildlife Services</h3>\n        <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9413 4300</p>\n        <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:info@sydneywildlife.org.au\">info@sydneywildlife.org.au</a></p>\n        \n        \n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Lane Cove National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chatswood (3km)</li>\n<li>Ryde (5km)</li>\n<li>Pennant Hills (2km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (11km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney take the Pacific Highway to Chatswood and turn left into Fullers Road:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn right into Lady Game Drive just before crossing the bridge</li>\n<li>Take the first left into Max Allen Drive for the northern side of the river</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OR</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross Fullers Bridge and then turn right into Riverside Drive, this will take you to the southern side of the river</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Ryde, take Lane Cove Road and turn right into Riverside Drive, just past Eden Gardens.</p>\n<p>From Pennant Hills there are several pedestrian access points to the park, including via Britannia Street and Ferguson Avenue.</p>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Lane Cove National Park is accessible from North Ryde station and by bus from Chatswood station. For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW transport info website\" href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Lane Cove National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:<br></p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b> <br>\nThe Dunghutti people from Kempsey and the Biripai people from Port Macquarie continue to have a strong connection with the area surrounding Limeburners Creek. Point Plomer and Big Hill in particular are Aboriginal sites of outstanding significance. Several sites and artefacts tracing Aboriginal settlement in this region back to at least 6000 years have been found, including burial sites, shell middens, a quarry for stone tool production and axe grinding grooves in rock outcrops around Point Plomer.</p>\n<p><b>A place of historic heritage</b> <br>\nBack in the early days of the Port Macquarie penal settlement, lime for building mortar was in great demand. They used to collect and burn enormous quantities of oyster shells from this area, giving the park its unusual name. Many of the landmarks in the park were named after some of the more colourful pioneers of the past. Barries Bay was originally a whaling station, named after the Barrie family who lived there for many years. Big Hill was named after Kevin Hill, reputedly a hermit who lived on the northwest side of the hill during the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>\n<p><b>Wildlife and birdwatching haven<br></b>Limeburners Creek National Park is a hot spot for animals. Spotted tail quoll, dingos, butterflies, micro bats, giant pythons and even brolgas make their home here. Birdwatchers will also be in heaven. You’ll see rare pied oystercatchers and little terns along beaches, osprey and other large birds of prey circling above and migratory seabirds on their journey north. You might also see the rare ground parrot out in the grass and heathlands.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001134","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Macleay area (local office)</h3>\n    <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6566 6621<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Cardwell St Arakoon NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8.30am - 4.30pm, Monday to Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Limeburners Creek National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crescent Head (17km)</li>\n<li>Port Macquarie (18km)</li>\n<li>Kempsey (38km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Kempsey or Crescent Head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive towards Crescent Head from Kempsey</li>\n<li>As you enter Crescent Head village, turn right into Point Plomer Road, also known as Bakers Road.</li>\n<li>Continue 14km on sometimes rough gravel road to the park</li>\n<li>Point Plomer is a further 3km</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Port Macquarie:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suitable for 4WD only</li>\n<li>Take the Settlement Point Ferry to North Shore</li>\n<li>From Riverside Drive, turn right onto Shoreline Drive.</li>\n<li>Continue onto North Shore Drive</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Plomer Road and follow to the park</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Limeburners Creek National Park is not accessible by public transport.

Here are just some of the reasons why:<br></p>\n<p><b>Rich in Aboriginal heritage<br></b>Little Llangothlin Lagoon and the surrounding wetlands were originally home to the Banbai Aboriginal people, who camped by the lagoons seasonally for their water and food resources such as waterfowl, eels, tortoises and grey kangaroos. Today, Aboriginal stories, scar trees and artefacts remind us of the significant Aboriginal heritage of this area, both past and present.<br></p>\n<p><b>Pastoral historic heritage</b> <br>\nEuropean settlers started moving into the Llangothlin district around 1840 to graze sheep and cattle, and later for wheat farming. The reserve was initially part of a large 50,000-acre sheep property, called Llangollin, but was subdivided in the 1860s for the influx of new settlers. A sluice gate and drainage ditch were used to drain the lagoon, creating additional grazing land. As you explore the reserve, you may see some of the remaining relics of its former life.</p>\n<p><b>Ramsar-listed wetlands</b><br>\nLittle Llangothlin Lagoon and the surrounding wetlands are internationally-recognised by the Convention of Wetlands of International Importance, or the <a title=\"Ramsar Convention\" href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/wetlands/RamsarWetlands.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Ramsar Convention</a>. This area is one of the few remaining high altitude freshwater lagoons on the New England Tableland and supports a great diversity of plant life including distinct groups of sedgeland, herbland and grassy woodlands. You’ll also find tree species such as snowgum, New England peppermint and silver wattle.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatching paradise</b><br>\nWith over 100 bird species recorded here, Little Llangothlin offers excellent birdwatching opportunities. It provides habitats for vulnerable and rare species such as the Australasian bittern, comb-crested jacana and blue-billed duck. The lagoon is also an important drought refuge for many water birds. If you look high above, you could see raptors like brown falcons, nankeen kestrels and white-breasted sea eagles gliding overhead.</p>\n<p><b>Native animals<br></b>You’ll also find plenty of native animals here, even rare species such as the New England bell frog. The lagoon contains many rare and restricted populations of invertebrates including the only known location of a genus of planktonic flatworms.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Lands of plenty<br></b>Livingstone National Park is Wiradjuri Country. The land and all within it has great importance to local Aboriginal spirituality and culture; art, ceremonial sites and spiritual places are throughout this outstanding landscape. Many plants, such as grass trees and mugga ironbark, have been used to produce shields, medicine and boomerangs. Livingstone is covered by the Wagga Wagga Local Aboriginal Land Council, so when you’re in this country, you’re in a place where Aboriginal culture is integral to its past, present and future.</p>\n<p><b>Wild about flowers<br></b>During spring, you’ll see an abundance of beautiful plants flowering in Livingstone. Bursts of purple Austral indigo interspersed with yellow kangaroo thorn, cream-coloured grass trees, and nodding blue lily (which is actually purple) form a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours. A population of Yass Daisy, a threatened species, occurs in Livingstone – the most south westerly limit of its known range. Six distinctive forest ecosystems here make for a uniquely varied, interesting landscape.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage<br></b>Livingstone National Park was once pastoral holdings until the area was converted to a state forest in 1917. Continuous, though limited, mining occurred from 1872 to 1950, and again in the early 1980s. Early mining activity was for gold and, in later times, wolframite. Today, there is still evidence of trenches, mullock heaps, and mine shafts.</p>\n<p><b>An abundance of animals<br></b>The park contains a diverse range of native animals, including five amphibian species, nine reptile species, 15 mammal species, and 185 species of birds. Many threatened species have been recorded here, and it’s a sanctuary for swift, superb and turquoise parrots, barking owls, hooded robins, and diamond firetails.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001064","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tumut</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6947 7025<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:tumutrvc@environment.nsw.gov.au\">tumutrvc@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> The Old Butter Factory, Adelong Road, Tumut<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Livingstone National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wagga Wagga (30 km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Wagga Wagga:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The northern end of Livingstone National Park can be reached via Holbrook Wagga Road, O’Brian’s Creek Road and Wrigley’s Road, approximately 30km south of Wagga Wagga.</li>\n<li>To access the southern end of the park, take Holbrook Road from Wagga Wagga for approximately 33km.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Visit historic Roto House<br></b>The distinctive feature of Macquarie Nature Reserve is the lovingly preserved Roto House, a rare surviving example of a late Victorian country house. Built for surveyor John Flynn in 1891, the house was occupied by his family right up until 1979 and was restored by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service in the early 1980s. Walk around the rooms imagining life for the area’s settlers before enjoying a picnic in the pretty grounds.</p>\n<p><b>Victorian gardens in the bush</b> <br>\nSurrounding Roto House and the Koala Hospital is open woodland with grassed areas, and you’ll find heritage plantings dotted around the grounds. These are the remains of an orchard, vineyard, garden and exotic plantings. Look out for the large old magnolia, and its springtime fragrant white flowers, the size of a dinner dish. A gnarly mulberry bush can be seen at the southern end of the house, and large Norfolk and Bunyah pines are to the north of the house, where the Flynn family once had garden parties and played tennis with their guests.</p>\n<p><b>Explore diverse habitats<br></b>Amid the urban landscape of the seaside town of Port Macquarie, the reserve and historic site protect a significant area of diverse vegetation, including rainforest, sclerophyll woodland, swamp vegetation and coastal banksia. This relatively small reserve is easily covered on foot, so you and your family can explore the different habitats of the park after your picnic or visit the attractions.</p>\n<p><b>Meet the wildlife<br></b>The reserve is part of a major habitat corridor for the koala and other animals native to the Port Macquarie region. Since 1975, the Koala Hospital has provided a shelter for koalas and is one of the leading koala recovery and rehabilitation centres in Australia. Other threatened species in the reserve are the barred cuckoo-shrike, square-tailed kite, grey-headed flying fox and glossy black cockatoo.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Macquarie Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Port Macquarie (2km)</li>\n<li>Laurieton (32km)</li>\n<li>Kempsey (52km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Port Macquarie CBD:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head east along Gordon Street to the roundabout intersection with Lord Street</li>\n<li>Turn right into Lord Street and head south</li>\n<li>Follow the brown and white tourism signs for Historic Roto House and the Koala Hospital, turning left into Roto Place.</li>\n<li>Turn right into Roto House historic site</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Wauchope:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head east along Oxley Highway to Port Macquarie and continue along Gordon Street to the roundabout intersection with Lord Street</li>\n<li>Turn right into Lord Street and head south</li>\n<li>Follow the brown and white tourism signs for Historic Roto House and the Koala Hospital, turning left into Roto Place.</li>\n<li>Turn right into the Roto House historic site</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Macquarie Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>A colourful escarpment</b><br>\nMacquarie Pass National Park covers a spectacular sandstone escarpment that glows a rich yellow and orange in the sunlight, contrasting with the lush, deep green of the forest. At its base lie massive boulders lined with ferns and orchids. It’s said that local Nurrewin House was built entirely from the stone of one boulder.</p>\n<p><b>An ancient route</b><br>\nIt’s thought that the track through Macquarie Pass followed a traditional path used by the Wodi Wodi people to travel between the coast and the highlands. Made into a track in 1863 and a road in 1898, it was so rugged that the brakes and radiators of the first cars had trouble coping. At least one went straight over the embankment. Today, it’s a much more enjoyable journey - the winding, steep Illawarra Highway gives travellers time to take a look at the beautiful landscape and forest.</p>\n<p><b>Diverse habitats</b><br>\nThe first thing visitors will notice in the park is the sheer size of the trees and the rainforest feel of the park, with plentiful figs, cabbage tree palms and vines. Tall open forest on the north and west slopes contains huge turpentine, brown barrel and gully gum, and there are three distinct types of rainforest in the park.</p>\n<p><b>Watch out for wildlife</b><br>\nIf you’re patient and lucky, you may see platypus in the larger watercourses and koalas in the forests. There are thought to be threatened broad-headed snakes here too, and you’re also likely to see grey-headed flying foxes feeding on native figs in season. The park is an important place for the conservation of tiger quolls and long-nosed potoroos. There’s plenty for birdwatchers to see too. Lyrebirds and satin bowerbirds wander about and the threatened powerful owl is also local to the area.</p>\n<p><b>The perfect climate for bushwalking</b><br>\nIn summer, take advantage of the dense shade and fern-lined watercourses criss-crossing the park. In winter, you’ll find that many parts of the park are much milder than the exposed highlands, which makes walking a pleasant thing to do all year round.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001018","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Illawarra</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4223 3000<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Illawarra@environment.nsw.gov.au\">Illawarra@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Ground Floor, 84 Crown Street, Wollongong NSW 2500<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-3:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Macquarie Pass National Park is close to:</p>\n<br><ul>\n<li>Robertson (12km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (35km)</li>\n<li>Nowra (75km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (120km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney and Wollongong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Princes Highway and Southern Freeway to the Illawarra Highway turnoff at Haywards Bay</li>\n<li>Travel about 14km along the Illawarra Highway, which veers right in Albion Park, to Macquarie Pass National Park.</li>\n</ul>\n<br><p>From Robertson:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Illawarra Highway east to reach Macquarie Pass National Park</li>\n</ul>\n<br><p>From Nowra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north along the Princes Highway and turn west into Tongarra Road at Albion Park Rail</li>\n<li>Travel about 15km along Tongarra Road , which becomes the Illawarra Highway, to Macquarie Pass National Park.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Macquarie Pass National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Bushranging country<br></b>With the discovery of gold and a regular Cobb and Co mail run, the lands of the reserve were once popular hunting grounds of renowned bushrangers such as ‘Captain Thunderbolt’ and ‘Black Tommy’ McPherson.</p>\n<p><b>Reptilian rapture<br></b>This reserve protects a wide range of lizards from the mighty lace monitor reaching up to 2m in length to the more diminutive blue-tongue lizard. Eastern water dragons are often seen sunning themselves on the riverbanks.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal gatherings<br></b>Due to its location at the bottom of the range leading to the coast, the reserve would have been a popular place for the Ngarabul People of the northern tablelands as well as the Gumbaynggir People to the south-east. It's believed the Ngarabul People travelled the mountains on a historic route that is known today as Old Grafton Road.</p>\n<p><b>Historic highways<br></b>Bordering the eastern edge of the reserve, Old Grafton Road was originally a timber getters track used to cart the valuable ‘red gold’ cedar trees in the 1840s. When the road was widened during the 1860s, Cobb and Co ran a weekly mail service along this road, linking Grafton and Glen Innes.</p>\n<p><b>Flocks in flight<br></b>With over 50 species of birdlife protected within the reserve, grab your binoculars for sightings of king parrots, yellow-faced honey-eaters and yellow-rumped thornbills. The magnificent raptor birds such as the peregrine falcon can often be seen surfing on mountain thermals. </p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001036","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Glen Innes</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6739 0700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 68 Church Street, Glen Innes NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mann River Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glen Innes (57km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (145km)</li>\n<li>Armidale (155km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Grafton:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive west of Grafton along Gwydir Highway for 125km</li>\n<li>Take the unsealed Old Grafton Road and drive for approximately 2km before descending 14km on sealed road to the base of Big Hill</li>\n<li>Drive for 150m on an unsealed road to the campground turnoff, or continue for 6km to the lookout.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Glen Innes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive east from Glen Innes for 37km along the Gwydir Highway</li>\n<li>Take the unsealed Old Grafton Road and drive for approximately 2km before descending 14km on sealed road to the base of Big Hill</li>\n<li>Drive for 150m on an unsealed road to the campground turn off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4WD only:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive the historic (unsealed) Old Grafton Road from Grafton for approximately 130 km.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Mann River Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Darug country<br></b>Marramarra is part of the traditional lands of the Darug Aboriginal people. Their use and respect of the land can be found in isolated corners of the park. Cave art, rock engravings, grinding grooves, middens, scarred trees, and other occupational deposits and stone arrangements are all part of Marramarra.</p>\n<p><b>Exploring the land<br></b>In the early days of the new colony, Hawkesbury River was a major communication route and supported an active river-based community. European exploration began as early as 1789 when Governor Arthur Phillip took his second trip up Hawkesbury River and camped at Gentlemans Halt. By 1884, there was a small community at Gentlemans Halt and a provisional school had been established; you can still see the foundations of a road and a wharf from this era. Other reminders of European historic heritage include remains of orange orchards along Marramarra Creek and the foundations of a hut, stone walls and a well at Big Bay.</p>\n<p><b>Plentiful lands<br></b>The sandstone ridges and deep gullies of Marramarra support a wide range of environments. Experience salt marsh and mangrove forests on the shores of Hawkesbury River, to tall open forest and ridge-top woodlands. In spring, the bush turns into a brilliant display of colour as the wildflowers burst in action. Discover the unique plant life and help preserve it – why not participate in the bush regeneration and <a title=\"volunteer programs in the park\" href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkVolunteering.aspx?id=N0052\" target=\"_blank\">volunteer programs in the park</a>?</p>\n<p><b>Is it a bird?<br></b>Marramarra is home to a great diversity of animals and birds, making it a great place for wildlife spotting and birdwatching. You’re likely to spot a white-breasted sea eagle, swamp wallaby, possum or kingfisher in your travels. If you’re lucky, you might come across some of the more uncommon animals found here such as rails, gang-gang and glossy black cockatoos, and red-crowned toadlets.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001055","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Sydney North  (Bobbin Inn, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9472 8949<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bobbin.head@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bobbin.head@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Bobbin Head Road, Mount Colah<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 10am-4pm daily or 9am-4pm during summer school holidays, closed 12:00pm-12:30pm (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Marramarra National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Arcadia (9km)</li>\n<li>Wisemans Ferry (25km)</li>\n<li>Hornsby (25km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (52km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Hornsby:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow Galston Road through Galston Gorge</li>\n<li>To access the southern precinct, turn right into Arcadia Road, then after approximately 4km, turn left into Cobah Road and continue along Bloodwood Road to the park.</li>\n<li>To access the northern precinct, continue through Galston and turn right onto Old Northern Road, then after approximately 18km, turn right into Canoelands Road.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Wisemans Ferry:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south on Old Northern Road towards Dural</li>\n<li>To access the northern precinct, turn left into Canoelands Road after approximately 18km.</li>\n<li>To access the southern precinct, after approximately 34km, turn left into Wylds Road, continue, then turn left into Arcadia Road.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>Meroo National Park forms part of the traditional lands of the Budawang and Murramarang tribes, who are part of the Dhurga language group. Meroo Lake has important spiritual significance for local Aboriginal groups because, along with other lakes in the region, it is connected to the Pigeon House Didthul creation stories that connect them with their country and ancestor spirits. The park is rich with archaeological sites including shell middens, open campsites, artefact scatters, stone arrangements, rock shelters and a burial site.</p>\n<p><b>Pristine natural landscapes<br></b>The coastal lakes, foreshores and wetlands you’ll find in Meroo are outstanding examples of pristine natural environments. Only 10% of NSW estuaries remain in such a natural condition. This unspoilt landscape supports endangered ecological communities like the swamp oak floodplain forest and bangalay-banksia dry forest and helps to protect vulnerable plant species such as the tangled bedstraw and leafless tongue orchid. </p>\n<p><b>Amazing wildlife<br></b>Meroo and Termeil Lakes are listed in the National Directory of Important Australian Wetlands and stand out for their abundance and diversity of mammals and frogs. The park also has at least 12 threatened fauna species, including significant populations of the nationally endangered green and golden bell frog.  As you explore the coastline keep a lookout to spot dolphins and whales off the coast.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatching haven<br></b>There are excellent opportunities for birdwatching at Meroo. You’ll see ducks, swans, pelicans, honeyeaters, superb blue wrens and pied oystercatchers.  You might also spot sea eagles or an osprey soaring overhead.  And if you are really lucky you may even see a pair of hooded plover. There are less than 25 pairs known to occur in NSW, and the Meroo, Termeil and Willinga Lake entrances are prime breeding habitats for this vulnerable species.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001220","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Ulladulla</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4454 9500<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Blackburn Industrial Estate, Lot 9 Coller Road, Ullladulla NSW</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001190","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nowra</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4423 2170<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 55 Graham Street, Nowra NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Meroo National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ulladulla (5km)</li>\n<li>Batemans Bay (35km)</li>\n<li>Moruya (60km)</li>\n<li>Canberra (180km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Ulladulla:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive approximately 5km south on Princes Highway to the start of Meroo National Park</li>\n<li>For the Lagoon Head precinct, turn left onto Pot Holes Road approximately 7km south of Ulladulla</li>\n<li>For the Termeil Point precinct, turn left onto Blackbutt Road approximately 14km south of Ulladulla</li>\n<li>For the Meroo Head precinct, turn left onto Meroo Point Road approximately 20km south of Ulladulla</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Batemans Bay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive approximately 34km north on Princes Highway to the start of Meroo National Park</li>\n<li>For the Meroo Head precinct, turn right onto Meroo Point Road approximately 35km north of Batemans Bay</li>\n<li>For the Termeil Point precinct, turn right onto Blackbutt Road approximately 38km north of Batemans Bay</li>\n<li>For the Lagoon Head precinct, turn right onto Pot Holes Road approximately 45km north of Batemans Bay</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Meroo National Park is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Meroo National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal influence<br></b>Middle Brother has significant cultural importance to the local Birpai people, the traditional owners of this land. Middle Brother Mountain is part of Aboriginal legend and connected, through story, to North Brother Mountain in nearby Dooragan National Park. The influence of Aboriginal culture is so large here that Benaroon, the enormous tree that draws many visitors every year, is actually named after the local word for ‘blackbutt'.</p>\n<p><b>A history of timber harvesting<br></b>The Three Brothers Mountains have also become a symbol of shared heritage between Aboriginal people and European settlers - without knowing it, Captain Cook gave the mountains the same name when he passed through the area hundreds of years ago. More recently, Middle Brother Mountain has a long history of timber harvesting, which links it with nearby towns in the Camden Haven area like Johns River, Batar and Kew.

The plants and animals within the park were a source of food, medicine and shelter for the Yuin people and the park’s landscape is strongly connected to Dreaming stories. Be sure to take the Mimosa Rocks walk for an insight into the Aboriginal heritage within the park.</p>\n<p><b>P</b><b>lant spectacular</b><br>\nWhen you’re driving from the south and about to cross the Bega River, you are sure to notice the knife edge boundary of spotted gum, with an understorey of burrawang palms; characteristic vegetation of Mimosa Rocks National Park. When exploring the dunes and cliffs of the park you’ll see coastal banksia, coast wattle and drooping she-oak that can withstand winds and salty air. Check the gullies for the tubular flowers of the endangered chefs hat correa, so called because it’s a similar shape to a chef’s hat.</p>\n<p><b>Wildlife haven</b><br>\nThe park provides refuge for koalas, swamp wallabies and ringtail possums, to name a few. Of an evening at Aragunnu campground, you may not see yellow-bellied gliders flitting between trees, but you might be able to hear their distinctive cackling sound that cuts through the silence of the night. At Gillards campground you may well see a long-nosed potoroo. About the size of a rabbit, they look quite similar to a bandicoot, except that they hop in a similar way to a kangaroo. The potoroo is nocturnal, so you are most likely to see them in the evening.</p>\n<p><b>Bygone eras</b><br>\nShipwrecks and mine shafts are just some of the park’s heritage attractions. Walk to ‘Riverview’ in the park’s south-east – the remains of these historic premises have important associations with the 19<sup>th</sup> century timber and coastal shipping industries. Visit Moon Bay, an old shipping port, to see a log-slide and mooring ring from bygone days.</p>\n<p><b>Birds of a feather</b><br>\nThe park is an important stop for many migratory birds that nest along the park’s coastline. Look along the beaches and rock platforms – you may see threatened hooded plovers or pied oystercatchers. The bar-tailed godwit stops by briefly in summer during its migration from Alaska to New Zealand. It’s a well deserved stop off as the bar-tailed godwit makes the longest known non-stop flight of any bird and the longest journey without pausing to feed by any animal. Look for them around the park’s lakes and lagoons.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001023","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Narooma</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4476 0800<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Cnr Graham & Burrawang Sts, Narooma NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mimosa Rocks National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tathra (5km)</li>\n<li>Bermagui (22km)</li>\n<li>Bega (25km)</li>\n<li>Merimbula (30km)</li>\n<li>Canberra (240km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p class=\"ListParagraph\">From Bermagui follow the main Tathra-Bermagui Road.</p>\n<p class=\"ListParagraph\">\n<p class=\"ListParagraph\">From Bega, take the Tathra Road off of the Princes Highway at Bega and turn north on the Tathwa - Bermagui Road.</p>\n<p class=\"ListParagraph\">\n<p class=\"ListParagraph\">From Merimbula take Sapphire Coast Drive north to Tathra.</p>\n<p class=\"ListParagraph\">\n<p class=\"ListParagraph\">Side roads from Tathra-Bermagui Road, north of Tathra will take you to all areas of the park.</p>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Mimosa Rocks National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>For over 14,000 years, the Yuin and Walbunja people have lived around the valleys of Clyde, Deua and Buckenbowra rivers. Walkers and horse riders can walk in their footsteps on Corn Trail walking track, which was one of the trails used by Aboriginal people to travel between the coast and the tablelands. There are many Aboriginal cultural sites in the park where stone artefacts, fire beacons and old campsites have been found.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage<br></b>Monga National Park is significant for its natural wonders and its historic heritage. Corn Trail walking track, which is today enjoyed by bushwalkers and horse riders, was the first trade route between the Buckenbowra Valley farmlands near the coast and the early European settlements on the tablelands near Braidwood. Further settlement came to the area in the 1840s, with the establishment of the timber trade and gold mining. The sawmill at Monga provided timber for Braidwood and the establishment of Canberra in the 1900s, with logging continuing in the area until 1987.</p>\n<p><b>Unique plants<br></b>Many of the plants you’ll find in the cool, temperate rainforests of Monga are millions of years in the making. Related to the plants from the super continent Gondwana, they present a unique window to the past.

It would have been a dangerous trip - 9km each way by bark canoe. There are many Aboriginal artefacts and middens on the island. Montague Island is known as Barunguba, and is the eldest son of Gulaga (Mount Dromedary) and a brother to Najunuka (Little Dromedary). The older brother, Barunguba was allowed out to sea while Najunuka, the younger brother, had to stay close to his mother.</p>\n<p><b>See the marine wildlife<br></b>The protected waters of Montague Island are a playground for hundreds of seals who make the island their home, all year round.</p>\n<p>Between September and November humpback and southern right whales pass the island on their annual migration south. Watch for blowholes and spectacular displays from the island or on a combined whale watching and island tour.</p>\n<p><b>A birdwatchers paradise<br></b>With more than 90 bird species seen on the island, and 15 species breeding there, you’ll be reaching for your binoculars – and camera – at every turn. Up to 8,000 penguins live on the island at any one time. Between September and March they are joined by three species of shearwaters, which can produce more than 12,000 chicks per year, and their colonies seem to be growing!</p>\n<p><b>Australian heritage<br></b>Get in touch with Australia’s colonial history – Captain James Cook spotted Montague Island from his tall ship in 1770, and the island was visited by shipwrecked sailors. Book an overnight stay at the lighthouse keeper’s cottage for the opportunity to relive the life of a lighthouse keeper on the remote South Coast.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001023","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Narooma</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4476 0800<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Cnr Graham & Burrawang Sts, Narooma NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Montague Island Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Narooma (9km)</li>\n<li>Bermagui (40km)</li>\n<li>Canberra (219km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>Access to the island is from Narooma, on the Far South Coast of NSW, about 4 hours south of Sydney and 2.5 hours from Canberra </p>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>\n<p> </p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you on Montague Island Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>This powerful place<br></b>Look At Me Now Headland is significant to local Gumbaynggirr people as an important mythological site and a powerful place within their homeland. Evidence of everyday lives of Aboriginal heritage and its people remains in the form of middens, campsites, ceremonial sites and areas where stone axes were ground. The name Moonee comes from ‘Munim-Munim’, which is the Gumbaynggirr name for the area. It means ‘rocky’, reflecting the original importance of this place for axe-making.</p>\n<p><b>Settling in<br></b>The 1880s were a big decade for newcomers to the area and the history is fascinating. From 1884, South Solitary Island signal station was operated by the Dammerel family. Only a couple of years into what would become a 40-year job, there was a collision at sea between <i>Keilawarra</i> and <i>Helen Nicoll</i>. Lone fossicker Frederick Fiddaman spent much of the 1880s searching for gold, and evidence of his toils can still be seen at Diggers Point. A century later, locals protested long and hard, successfully preventing the area becoming a site for sewage ocean outfall. Only in 1995 were Look At Me Now Headland, Diggers Point and Bare Bluff added to the reserve.</p>\n<p><b>Rare and threatened<br></b>Little bent-winged bats roost in nursery caves on the headlands of Moonee Beach Nature Reserve. Producing only one offspring each year and being particularly vulnerable to disturbance by humans, they are, unsurprisingly, an endangered species. Five threatened plant species survive in the salt spray and shallow soil on the surface of the headlands. To the untrained eye these plant communities, hidden within the grass, don’t look like much. But to a botanist they are EEC (ecologically endangered communities) and their plight probably keeps some of them awake at night.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001039","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coffs Harbour</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6652 0900<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 32 Marina Drive, Coffs Harbour NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Moonee Beach Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (15km)</li>\n<li>Port Macquarie (175km)</li>\n<li>Ballina (193km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Coffs Harbour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north on Pacific Highway and take Emerald Beach exit to access the main tourist information</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Moonee Beach Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>First inhabitants</b><br>\nThis region of northern NSW is the home of the Githabul Aboriginal people, for whom the rainforest was an extremely important source of food. There are several known sacred sites in the Northern Rivers area.</p>\n<p><b>Fragile forest</b><br>\nMuch of the landscape around here would have resembled that of Moore Park Nature Reserve before extensive logging and clearing took place during the 20th century. Now, this 14-hectare reserve represents one of the last remnants of the once much-larger Boyd’s Scrub, the most important example of black bean rainforest in the state. Robert J Moore, who was the Kyogle Shire Council president from 1920 to 1936, played a leading role in the council’s purchase of what remained of Boyd’s Scrub and the reserve is now named in his honour.</p>\n<p><b>Flying high</b><br>\nGrab a pair of binoculars and set your gaze high. Moore Park Nature Reserve is a well-known birdwatching area, with species including the tiny varied sittella (also called nuthatches), rose-crowned fruit dove, the barred cuckoo-shrike and the ground-dwelling bush hen. The reserve is also an essential habitat for winged mammals, with both grey-headed flying foxes and endangered black flying foxes raising their young in a canopy nursery from October to May.</p>\n<p><b>Meeting spot</b><br>\nEven before this park was created in 1989, it was an important place for the local community, who have enjoyed its serenity and scenery for decades. Many families would gather here and hold functions in what is now the picnic area beside the Richmond River. The area remains a popular destination for picnics and birdwatching.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001042","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Kyogle</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6632 0000<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:kyogle.area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">kyogle.area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 136 Summerland Way, Kyogle NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Moore Park Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kyogle (30km)</li>\n<li>Casino (60km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (780km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Kyogle<b>:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north, about 14km, along Summerland Way through Wiangaree</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue north on the Summerland Way another 12km to the intersection with Findon Creek Road at Old Grevillea</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north along Findon Creek Road about 1km to the picnic area.

Several hundred Aboriginal sites have been recorded here and there are likely many more. The park’s imposing mountains, particularly Didthul, are particularly significant in Aboriginal mythology, as is the majestic Fitzroy Falls. The park’s plateau and surrounding country also contain sites of great importance to Aboriginal people, whose occupation of the area dates back over 20,000 years.</p>\n<p>\n<p><b>A rugged beauty</b><br>\nMorton National Park envelops you in its fascinating landscape. Roam through rainforest on the Kangaroo Valley escarpment. Or relax on your picnic blanket, shaded by tall eucalyptus trees – the park has everything from Sydney peppermint to spotted gum and the rare Pigeon House Ash. The park’s geological features are equally captivating. Detect different rock types in the cliff face, or find a good vantage point and gaze at the plateau carved with deep gorges. Absorbing the gorges’ sheer size, coupled with their interesting terraced appearance, can keep you occupied for hours.</p>\n<p><b>Teeming with wildlife</b><br>\nThis large park is a sanctuary for all kinds of wildlife, so you’ll likely spot a critter or two while you’re here. Rainforest and moist eucalypt forest support swamp wallabies, gliders, bush rats and long-nosed potoroos. Birdwatchers will be tickled pink with Morton’s residents – satin bowerbirds, green catbirds and lyrebirds call the park home, while eagles and falcons hover overhead. You could be fortunate enough to see an endangered ground parrot in the heath. And, if it really is your lucky day, maybe you’ll meet a platypus or long-necked tortoise in one of the rivers.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001060","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4887 7270<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Morton National Park, Nowra Road, Fitzroy Falls NSW 2577<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Morton National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bundanoon (1.5km)</li>\n<li>Moss Vale (20km)</li>\n<li>Kangaroo Valley (12km)</li>\n<li>Nowra (40km)</li>\n<li>Ulladulla (40km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (65km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>It's half an hour drive from Moss Vale to Fitzroy Falls and Belmore Falls along Nowra Road.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><strong>Birds of a feather<br></strong>With over 87 species observed in and around it, Mother of Ducks Lagoon Nature Reserve is a major bird habitat. Head to the reserve between August and April to see the Japanese – or Latham’s – snipe, which every year makes the long journey from Japan to this rare high-country wetland. You’ll also see black swans, wading ibis and ducks diving for fish. Several endangered, threatened and vulnerable bird species rely on the reserve for survival, including the curlew sandpiper and grey falcon.</p>\n<p><strong>International headquarters<br></strong>With so many migratory birds calling it home at least part of the year, the reserve has real international significance. Mother of Ducks Lagoon Nature Reserve features birds protected under international agreements between Australia and Japan, China and Korea.</p>\n<p><strong>A changing world<br></strong>The beautiful Mother of Ducks Lagoon has a complex history. Over the years, it’s been drained for pastoral purposes, among others, and has suffered the effects of drought. It’s fascinating to imagine that years ago much of it would probably have been underwater.</p>\n<p><strong>An abundance of life<br></strong>There’s more to wetlands than birds, of course. The lagoon abounds with lush plant life, including tall spike-rush, common pondweed, Australian sweet grass and other carnivorous plants. Look carefully to see rare woodruff growing on the levee bank, and you might even see one of the many reptiles recorded in the park, such as the common snake-necked tortoise or the endangered Booroolong frog.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Show caves","id":"{C58C2DB9-8AC5-475D-84AD-4CB9F6B411DD}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001035","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Armidale (local office)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6738 9100     <br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 145 Miller Street, Armidale<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mother of Ducks Lagoon Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Armidale (37km)</li>\n<li>Glen Innes (60km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>Mother of Ducks Lagoon Nature Reserve is on the south-eastern edge of the township of Guyra.

The result? Mount Canobolas State Conservation Area boasts vents, dykes, peaks and plugs which all can be seen here and the large rocky outcrops are home to rare lichens, towering basalt cliff lines and impressive waterfalls.</p>\n<p><b>Ancient connections</b><br>\nMount Canobolas State Conservation Area incorporates the traditional land of the Wiradjuri people. The name Canobolas comes from the Wiradjuri words Gaahna Bulla meaning two shoulders, referring to the two main peaks, Old Man Canobolas and Young Man Canobolas. The area has a rich Aboriginal history and was an important place for male initiation ceremonies and stone tool making, as well as being a rich source of food and medicines. Find out more about the Aboriginal history of the area at Federal Falls campground.</p>\n<p><b>Go bush</b><br>\nThe high altitude, cool climate and moist environment make this fertile ground for more than 300 plant species in the region. Large areas of snow gum subalpine woodland, grassy woodland and rocky outcrops covered with a variety of mosses and lichens make this a great place to visit. It’s hard to say what is most beautiful here, but certainly the heaths in spring which burst with purple, white, yellow and red flowers are a sight to behold.</p>\n<p><b>An Australian menagerie</b><br>\nFeasting on the local vegetation day and night, you’ll probably catch a glimpse of the abundance of native animals which thrive in this environment. Thornbills, treecreepers, wrens and honeyeaters, as well as the good old magpies, currawongs, rosellas, kangaroos and wallabies call Mount Canobolas home. When the sun goes down, grab your torch to spot the many possums and wombats, all the while being serenaded by the southern boobook owl.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001044","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bathurst</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6332 7640<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 2, 203-209 Russell Street, Bathurst NSW 2795<p>To contact the KARST Conservation Unit in this office please call (02) 6332 7680</p><br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mount Canobolas State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Orange (20km)</li>\n<li>Bathurst (75km)</li>\n<li>Dubbo (160km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Orange, travel west out of town along Cargo Road (A32) and then turn left onto Lake Canobolas Road which becomes Pinnacle Road.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ngiyampaa:</b><b>Past</b><b>, present and future<br></b>The Ngiyampaa (pronounced nee-yam-par) are dryland people associated with the arid plains and rocky hill country of Central West NSW bordered roughly by Lachlan, Darling-Barwon and Bogan Rivers. The semi-permanent waterhole at Mount Grenfell was an important meeting place for generation after generation of this Aboriginal group. Following European settlement, however, Ngiyampaa people were moved to stations northwest of Wiradjuri country and in the 1930s, many were relocated again to Murrin Bridge near Lake Cargelligo. On 17 July 2004, Mount Grenfell was handed back to traditional owners and is now jointly managed with NSW NPWS. Ngiyampaa people maintain strong connections with this area and continue to pass on cultural knowledge.</p>\n<p><b>Making a scene<br></b>At Mount Grenfell, art featuring all facets of Aboriginal life covers rocky overhangs surrounding the park’s waterhole. Many are linear paintings done by applying wet pigment with a fingertip or natural brush. Others are hand stencils. In some places, ochre and white pipeclay have been applied thickly and left to dry. More recent paintings have been superimposed over older ones. There are stick figures, human figures, images of birds and animals, medicine, food, the landscape and dreaming stories. This art remains deeply significant to Ngiyampaa people.</p>\n<p><b>Living off the land<br></b>Emus and kangaroos inhabit Mount Grenfell and, on warmer days, you’re likely to see bearded dragons, shinglebacks and geckos. Keep a careful eye out too for endangered kultarr (also known as jerboa pouched-mouse, wuhl-wuhl or pitchi-pitchi), which can best be described as a mouse that hops. While you’re looking down for a pitchi-pitchi, you may also see a red-capped robin rifling through the leaf litter. This bird is often part of a mixed species feeding flock with other similarly sized birds such as thornbills, which also inhabit the park.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001051","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Cobar</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6836 2692<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 16-19 Barton Street, Cobar NSW 2835<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday, (closed 1:00pm-2:00pm)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mount Grenfell Historic Site is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Cobar (70km)</li>\n<li>Dubbo (370km)</li>\n<li>Griffith (420km)</li>\n<li>Broken Hill (434km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Cobar:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Drive 40km west on Barrier Highway, then turn right at the sign for Mount Grenfell.</li>\n<li>Travel for approximately 30km on gravel road and turn right into Mount Grenfell Historic Site</li>\n<li>Continue along gravel road until you reach the picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Mount Grenfell Historic Site.

The mountain, surrounding gullies, forest and animals that make their home here are important to local Aboriginal culture and spiritual teachings.</p>\n<p><b>Band of brothers<br></b>Mount Imlay is named after the three Imlay brothers, who played an important part in opening the Eden-Monaro district to European settlement in the 1830s and 40s. Alexander, Peter and George Imlay arrived in Australia from Scotland in 1829, 1830 and 1833 respectively. Within a few years, they had established whaling, pastoral and trading enterprises near Twofold Bay at Eden and on the Monaro plains.</p>\n<p><b>Exquisite growth<br></b>Mount Imlay is a botanical treasure of the far south east, where you’ll find a number of threatened or biogeographically significant plant species, including the extremely rare Mount Imlay mallee and endangered Mount Imlay boronia. The bushland here also supports many native wildflowers, which come to life in spring and colour the bushland with purple, pink, yellow, white and red flowers.</p>\n<p><b>Hidden wildlife<br></b>Many of the animals that make Mount Imlay their home are nocturnal, like the eastern pygmy-possum. But during the day, you could see red-necked wallabies, swamp wallabies, wombats and bush rats.

The park provided a rich resource for food, medicines, shelter and weapons and the landscape is part of Dreaming stories. Reminders of the Kamilaroi’s connection to this ancient landscape are evident in Aboriginal rock carvings, campsites, marks on trees and axe grinding grooves throughout the park.</p>\n<p><b>Over 20 million years in the making</b><br>\nTwo volcanos pushed Mount Kaputar high above the plains, and millions of years of erosion have carved a dramatic landscape of narrow valleys and steep ridges. Many of the mountains are ancient lava terraces. Experience ancient history for yourself by standing on Kaputar Plateau – an excellent example of a lava terrace. Or visit Sawn Rocks to see one of Australia’s best examples of a spectacular rock formation called organ-piping - it really does look like a wall of giant organ pipes.</p>\n<p><b>A harsh lifestyle</b><br>\nSeveral pioneering families lived in the Mount Kaputar area in extremely harsh conditions. Stockmen looked after sheep and cattle on the Kaputar Plateau, often going for months without seeing another person. Enjoy a walk to the historic Scutts Hut to experience the pioneers’ harsh lifestyle. The Scutt family lived in the hut in the 1940s and 50s, and it has been carefully restored to its original condition. The hut and most of the furniture were built from local timber, and all other materials were brought in by horse - even the rainwater tank.</p>\n<p><b>Colourful locals</b><br>\nMount Kaputar is famous for a very unusual, colourful local – a bright pink slug. It can be seen after rain on rocks, trees and amongst the leaf litter. With birds from both the east and west meeting together at Mount Kaputar, the park is also a wonderful place to go bird watching. More than 185 bird species live in the park, so don’t forget your binoculars. A torch will also come in handy for seeing some of the other locals that come out at night, including possums and greater gliders. And watch out for the many kangaroos and wallabies, too.</p>\n<p><b>Enjoy a cycling</b><b> adventure</b><br>\nTest yourself by riding your mountain bike up the steep Mount Kaputar road to the Kaputar Plateau.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>An important place<br></b>The area now covered by Mount Royal National Park, Barrington Tops National Park and Barrington Tops State Conservation Area is the traditional land of the Biripi, Worimi, Geawegal, Wonaruah and Ungooroo People. Although these people were dispossessed of their land after European settlement of New South Wales, they continue to have a deep attachment to the country and an active interest in its management. This place contains important foods, medicinal plants, animal species and sites.</p>\n<p><b>The changing face<br></b>After government surveyors explored this area in the very early 1800s, the land soon became mined for gold, logged for its timber and used to graze lifestock. Small settlements established themselves on the plateau, mainly due to these agricultural opportunities. From the early 1900s, however, the area became increasingly popular for recreation and for scientific expeditions. </p>\n<p><b>Same as always<br></b>Mount Royal National Park is listed as part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. Formerly known as the Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves, these include the most extensive areas of subtropical rainforest in the world, large areas of warm temperate rainforests and nearly all of the Antarctic beech cool temperate rainforest.

From 1860 to 1920, intrepid gold mining pioneers created mining sites and a walking track. Visit the disused mines and wander along to the track and imagine how they built these by hand to transport water from the creek to mining areas.</p>\n<p><b>Unique plant life<br></b>Large swathes of vegetation on the flatter areas of Mullion Range State Conservation Area have remained relatively undisturbed, thanks to the area’s mining and logging past. This means you can see a number of plant species and communities here that are rarely found elsewhere in central western NSW, including inland scribby gum, red stringybark and river oak.</p>\n<p><b>Ancient volcanic formations<br></b>A prominent feature of the landscape are the Bathurst and Orange region’s dramatic, distinct, but extinct, volcanic systems, which make for a striking landscape of undulating, at times steeply sloping hills, featuring dramatic rocky outcrops.</p>\n<p><b>Birds of a feather<br></b>Mullion Range provides habitat for many unique and interesting species of woodland birds, such as native parrots, including eastern rosella and crimson rosella, superb parrots in the springtime, and owls.</p>\n<p><b>Get among the animals<br></b>Whether you’re on foot, mountain bike or in a 4WD, you’re likely to spot interesting wildlife here. See eastern grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies and wallaroos bounding through open fields, gliders scurrying among the treetops, or platypus paddling their way along the creek.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001044","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bathurst</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6332 7640<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 2, 203-209 Russell Street, Bathurst NSW 2795<p>To contact the KARST Conservation Unit in this office please call (02) 6332 7680</p><br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mullion Range State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Orange (17km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Orange:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north-east along Ophir Road 17km to entrance walk gate or 19km to Fourth Crossing picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you at Mullion Range State Conservation Area.

They may also have lived in the area permanently, drawing on the land and water biodiversity to inform their spiritual beliefs and cultural identity.</p>\n<p><b>The journey of John Oxley, the legacy of logging</b><br>\nThe famous explorer John Oxley would have travelled in the vicinity of Mummel Gulf National Park on his crossing from Apsley Falls to the coast in 1818. Later, though little evidence remains, small-scale mining and grazing took place in the area. More notable are the logging trails – logging here ultimately caused a series of protests in the 1990s, which resulted in the creation of many national parks in the North-East of NSW.</p>\n<p><b>Forests worth protecting<br></b>What were the anti-logging protesters trying to protect? Mummel Gulf National Park is notable for its wide variety of plant life, not to mention the animals which rely on the biodiversity. Your visit will expose you to everything from sclerophyll forests to warm temperate rainforests, and, if you’re lucky, ant orchids and greenhoods – both threatened species.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001037","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Walcha</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6777 4700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 188W North Street, Walcha NSW 2354<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mummel Gulf National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Nowendoc (32km)</li>\n<li>Walcha (68km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<ul>\n<li>From Oxley Highway, take Enfield Road and drive for 12km, turning right into Mummel Forest Road.</li>\n<li>From Nowendoc, take Brackendale Road and then turn right into Mummel Forest Road.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>There is no public transport available for Mummel Gulf National Park.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Mummel Gulf National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Trading places<br></b>Munghorn Gap has been inhabited by Aboriginal people for over 12,000 years. Once a major trading route between the Blue Mountains and the plains, Munghorn Gap continues to be a significant place to local Wiradjuri people.</p>\n<p><b>Back and forth<br></b>After Europeans settled in the region, Munghorn Gap became a route for horse and bullock teams connecting Wollar, Merriwa and Mudgee. Evidence of past blacksmithing, timber-cutting, peat and coal mining, prospecting, and quarrying can still be found in and around the reserve.</p>\n<p><b>Birds of a feather<br></b>As far as birdwatchers are concerned, Munghorn Gap is a happening place to go twitching. Over 164 different species of birds inhabit the reserve either permanently or seasonally, and many of these are rare and uncommon. They come in all shapes and sizes, from Australia’s tallest bird, the emu, to the country’s smallest, the 8-9cm weebill. Many are brightly coloured, such as rare scarlet honeyeaters and flame robins, while others like jackie winters and tree martins are more subdued in appearance. Bowerbirds and lyrebirds can be seen in Munghorn Gap along with national favourites like kookaburras, magpies and galahs. Birds of prey include wedge-tailed eagles, whistling kites, collared sparrowhawks, peregrine falcons and brown goshawks. After dark the boobook and owls - powerful, barking, and barn - take over for the nightly hunt.</p>\n<p><b>Let’s get physical<br></b>Great Dividing Range stretches the length of Eastern Australia and creates an interface between the western plains and the mountains. Munghorn Gap is one of the lowest points of the range and lies on the extreme western edge of the Sydney-Bowen geological basin. Parts of the reserve drain into Cudgegong River and, in turn, the Macquarie River system.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001006","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Mudgee</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6370 9000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 27 Inglis Street, Mudgee NSW 2850<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Thursday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Munghorn Gap Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Mudgee (35km)</li>\n<li>Muswellbrook (135km)</li>\n<li>Dubbo (162km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (245km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Mudgee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north on Church Street</li>\n<li>Continue onto Ulan Road for 9km</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Wollar Road and follow for 26km</li>\n<li>Munghorn Gap Nature Reserve occupies both sides of the road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Munghorn Gap Nature Reserve is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Munghorn Gap Nature Reserve.

The Palms circuit track and the Moonee Beach trail are enjoyable walks that take you through very different but equally impressive vegetation and scenery. The park is an anglers with myriad places to drop a line. Keen surfers and hang gliders in the know also head to Munmorah.</p>\n<p>When it’s warm you can snorkel, swim and explore rockpools at the idyllic Birdie and Frazer beaches, and in the winter months go whale watching at Wybung Head or the Tea Tree lookout.</p>\n<p><b>Coast and beaches to crow about</b><br>\nWhether you’re having lunch at the Elizabeth Bay picnic area or exploring the rock pools at the stunning Moonee Beach, Munmorah has some of the best coastline in the state. Frazer beach boasts a lagoon perfect to laze in when the weather's scorching, and the sandy beach is patrolled during the Christmas and Easter holidays.</p>\n<p>The 4km stretch of sand at Birdie beach is also a favourite, while to the far north there’s a nude bathing area. Dramatic panoramic views of the coastal cliffs and heath are another popular feature, especially from Wybung Head and on the walk down to Moonee Beach.</p>\n<p><b>Animal magic</b><br>\nA huge number of bird and animal species call Munmorah State Conservation Area home. You’ll probably spot the commonly found ringtail possum and sugar glider,  and if you’re really lucky, you might see the vulnerable squirrel glider, which lives in the eucalypt woodlands and rainforest in the northern part of the park.</p>\n<p>Scores of birds also come to rest at Munmorah as part of their long migratory journey - some flying from as far away as China and Japan. Look for gulls, terns, migratory waders and herons roosting on Munmorah’s rocky platforms and feeding at the lake foreshore. If you’re patient you might even spot the endangered little tern, or the vulnerable osprey and sooty oystercatcher.</p>\n<p><b>Bushtucker wonderland</b><br>\nThe original inhabitants of Munmorah, the Awabakal people, settled in an area abundant with food like the plentiful cabbage palm, lilly pilly, acacia seed, yams and flower nectars. They supplemented their diet with shellfish collected from rocks and fish caught with lines and spears in the rivers and lakes then cooked on small hearths onboard their canoes. The Awabakal people were also known to have visited Moon Island to gather muttonbird chicks and eggs, and hunted various mammals and reptiles on land.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001016","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Lake Munmorah</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4972 9000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Blue Wren Drive, Munmorah State Conservation Area<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Munmorah State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Catherine Hill Bay (3.5km)</li>\n<li>Budgewoi (4.5km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (40km)</li>\n<li>Gosford (41km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Catherine Hill Bay:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head south on the Pacific Highway (state route 111) for 3.5km</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Blue Wren Drive to enter from the park’s northern entry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Budgewoi:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north on Elizabeth Bay Drive for 4.5km</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Birdie Beach Drive which leads to the park's southern entry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Gosford:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north on the Pacific Highway for 41km and take Elizabeth Bay Drive</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Munmorah State Conservation Area.

There are over 900 plant species found in Muogamarra – an extraordinary amount given its relatively small size and proximity to the city. The spring wildflower displays will dazzle visitors with their bright colours. Get up close and see beautiful displays of native orchids, bright pink eriostemons, purple boronias and towering Gymea lilies.</p>\n<p><b>Rich in Aboriginal significance</b><br>\nWhen you step into Muogamarra Country, you are on the traditional lands of the Guringai people. The Guringai lived in the area for at least 20,000 years prior to European settlement, making extensive use of the Hawkesbury River and adjacent ridgelines. Evidence of Aboriginal heritage can be seen in engravings and shell middens found throughout the reserve: discover the significance of Muogamarra to Aboriginal people today on a Muogamarra Indigenous heritage walk.</p>\n<p><br><b>A snapshot of colonial times gone by</b><br>\nYou’ll also find remnants of colonial history at Muogamarra. During the 1830s and 1840s, several roads were built throughout the area, providing vital transport routes between Sydney and the Hawkesbury River. Remains of dry stone walls, culverts and foundations of earlier buildings can be found in the reserve.</p>\n<p><b>Friendly locals</b><br>\nWith such beautiful surroundings, it’s no wonder so many native animals make their home at Muogamarra. Fourteen species of native mammals, including the swamp wallaby, brush tail possum and echidna reside here. Also, 16 reptile species and 140 native birds have been recorded in the area.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Vast Aboriginal history<br></b>There are very few sites on the NSW South Coast with this much heritage. Material found at Murramarang has been dated back to an astounding 12,000 years. The headland, with its rock platforms, fishing, and nesting sea birds, was an important meeting point for Aboriginal people. Large fires where people cooked their food would have been visible for miles, and some archaeological finds suggest people in this area ate whales and dolphins. These days, the area is still used by local Aboriginal people for fishing, recreational and educational activities. Signs along the walking track identify some of the most important features of the area.</p>\n<p><b>First sightings<br></b>When Captain Cook first spotted what he would later call Pigeon House Mountain from the sea, he sailed towards the coast to see if he could find a safe place to anchor. On 22 April 1770, he made his first sighting of Aboriginal people – some in bark canoes, others on land – here at Murramarang. Incidentally, the Aboriginal name for Pigeon House is ‘Didthul’, which is connected to the ocean through Dreaming stories. The first white settlers came to the area to graze cattle and cut timber in the late 1820s.</p>\n<p><b>In a flap<br></b>Because of the preservation of nature here and its proximity to the coast, Murramarang is a great place to go birdwatching. There are many species of threatened seabirds – including the sooty oystercatcher and hooded plover – living on the beaches. Swan Lagoon is an important habitat for waterbirds, including the black swan, little pied cormorant and white-faced heron. Sea eagles and osprey can often be seen swooping over the water.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001060","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4887 7270<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Morton National Park, Nowra Road, Fitzroy Falls NSW 2577<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Murramarang Aboriginal Area is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bawley Point (2km)</li>\n<li>Ulladulla (30km)</li>\n<li>Batemans Bay (35km)</li>\n<li>Canberra (150km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (250km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Ulladulla:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow Princes Highway south to Termeil</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Bawley Point Road and drive to its end</li>\n<li>Turn right into Murramarang Road</li>\n<li>About 2.5km down the road, you’ll come to Sand Mines carpark on the left.</li>\n<li>There’s a 600m walking track from here to the boundary of the reserve</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a></p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you at Murramarang Aboriginal Area.

The south coast headlands have long been a focus for economic life, giving easy access to the food resources of both the sea and the land, and plants within the park provided medicines and shelter. There is much evidence of the past today, including shell middens, tool manufacturing sites and indications of a specialised industry producing bone points and fishing hooks. Take a walk around Murramarang Aboriginal Area, near Bailey Point – there’s a complex of middens that are of great cultural value.</p>\n<p><b>Native vegetation</b><br>\nOne of the really special things in Murramarang is the forest of majestic spotted gums; it’s one of the biggest continuous stands in NSW. With an understorey of burrawang palms, the forest stretches right down to the ocean and is truly a sight to see. You’ll easily recognise the spotted gums – they have a smooth, dimpled bark which is shed in summer to produce a mottled cream and grey ‘spotted’ appearance.</p>\n<p><b>Native animals</b><br>\nThere’s an abundance of wildlife living in Murramarang National Park, but by far one of the highlights is seeing eastern grey kangaroos that spend their days dozing near the beaches and by campgrounds until dusk when they gather to feed. In the moist forests of the park you might see lyrebirds fossicking in leaf litter. Look for the stately, strutting wonga pigeon with its pastel blue-grey back feathers and black dotted stomach. If you don’t see it, you may well hear its repetitive, deep ‘whoop, whoop’ call that carries through the forest.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatching</b><br>\nBirdwatchers are in for a treat; the park boasts more than 90 species of birdlife including three owl species, peregrine falcons, sea eagles, gannets, shearwaters, white-faced storm petrels, sooty oystercatchers, eastern yellow robins, satin bowerbirds, the rufous fantail and even a penguin colony. Look for the sea eagles and peregrine falcons soaring above the park’s cliffs and headlands and the rufous fantails and eastern yellow robins in rainforest gullies around Durras Mountain.

The landscape and all that it contains; rivers, forests, birds and animals are part of cultural beliefs and feature in Dreaming stories. The park provided a wealth of resources, including plants that were used as medicines and in tool making. The river was a rich food source; in some seasons the water was so clear and the fish plentiful. When you’re exploring the park, keep your eyes open for Aboriginal sites, especially middens, oven mounds and scarred trees, where bark has been removed from the tree to make canoes, coolamons and shields.</p>\n<p><b>River red gum country</b><br>\nThis iconic landscape features the huge river red gums soaring from the banks of the Murray and wetlands that make up this part of the Riverina’s important ecosystem. This new park, formed from a number of former state forests, is part of the largest continuous river red gum forest in the southern hemisphere and is an important and unique ecosystem.</p>\n<p><b>An abundance of treasures</b><br>\nThe Ramsar-listed Murray Valley wetland is home to over 60 threatened native animal species and 40 threatened plant species. Lay down the paddle of your canoe and sit in the silence, enjoying the company of egrets and cormorants, and keep an eye out for the superb parrot, slender and bright green. You may also see night herons, black swans, yellow rosellas, ducks, falcons, cockatoos, tree creepers, pardalotes, kingfishers and owls - this is truly a bird-lover’s paradise.</p>\n<p><b>Forestry history</b><br>\nThe magnificent river red gums have made this an important area for forestry and milling since the mid-nineteenth century. By the 1870's, construction of railway lines brought great demand for red gum sleepers; logging became a key feature of this area’s industry. Wood-chopping events have long been a feature of local festivals and many people who live in Mathoura are third and fourth-generation timber workers.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20110119121741016","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Moama (Murray Area)</h3>\n        <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 03 5483 9100</p>\n        \n        <p><strong>Street address:</strong> Factory 5, Lot 8 Bowlan Road, Moama NSW 2731</p>\n        \n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"","car":"","public_transport":"","bike":"","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Murray Valley National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Wiradjuri people<br></b>River red gums have been important to Wiradjuri people, the traditional land owners of Murrumbidgee Valley, for thousands of years. As well as being used for making canoes and shields, they also provide warmth, shelter and food. Some river red gums were large enough for individuals to sleep in, and light a small fire during the cold nights.  Even today, Wiradjuri artists in Narrandera use river red gum to make boomerangs, coolamons and carved didgeridoos.</p>\n<p><b>Take me to the river<br></b>Murrumbidgee River flows in an easterly direction and is over 1,600km long. Murrumbidgee Valley national and regional parks access over 500km of river frontage at irrigation hubs of Narrandera, Yanco, Leeton, the plains of Maude and Hay, and the edge of the mallee at Balranald. River red gums benefit from times of flooding as it recharges the subsoil with water. The river supports river red gums forests, which in turn support the banks of the river with their root systems. Logged since the 1820s and managed as forests by the government since the early 1900s, in 2010 NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service protected 107,000ha of river red gums by creating new parks and reserves, which will now be enjoyed for generations to come.</p>\n<p><b>Water, water everywhere<br></b>Europeans settled the area in the 1840s. By the early 1900s, private irrigation works were replaced by government projects to develop Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA). Eventually, MIA supplied water to an area of 182,000ha and enabled subdivision of grazing land into smaller units of mixed farming, horticulture, dairy and sheep. During the 1950s, Italian migrants to Australia were drawn to the area because of its similar climate and soil to Italy and became integral in the success of Riverina agriculture.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20081105164332131","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Hay Area</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6990 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 339A Murray Street Hay 2711<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20101207150001106","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Yanga National Park</h3>\n        <p><strong>Phone:</strong> (03) 5020 1764</p>\n        \n        <p><strong>Street address:</strong> Sturt Highway, Balranald NSW 2715</p>\n        <p><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am - 4:30pm (7 days)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Murrumbidgee Valley National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hay (6km)</li>\n<li>Narrandera (15km)</li>\n<li>Griffith (83km)</li>\n<li>Wagga Wagga (110km)</li>\n<li>Canberra (340km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Narrandera to Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area I (MIA I):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel northwest on Irrigation Way for about 12km</li>\n<li>Turn left off Irrigation Way at the signpost for MIA I</li>\n<li>Follow access road in southerly direction for about 2.5km to grid</li>\n<li>This is Grahams Grave entrance to MIA I</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Narrandera to Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area II (MIA II):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head south along Newell Highway onto Audley Street, turning right onto Irrigation way.

Communities have performed initiations, rainmaking and other ceremonies here in gatherings of up to 1000 people. A short, easy walk, suitable for wheelchairs, will guide you amid the splendour of Mutawintji's gorges to the rocky overhang Thaaklatjika (Wright's Cave). Here you’ll find paintings, stencils and engravings that depict pre and post colonial Aboriginal history, as well as the animals that live in the area, including kangaroos and emus.</p>\n<p><b>Iconic scenery</b><br>\nMutawintji National Park displays the classic outback landscape for which Australia is famous around the world. Driving along red dirt roads among rugged gorges and desert, against the backdrop of the ever-changing colour of the Byngnano Ranges, you’ll discover the peace and space of the desert. Beyond the ridges, the saltbush and mulga plains stretch to the horizon, making city life seem a long, long way away.</p>\n<p><b>A wildlife wonderland</b><br>\nIt might feel peaceful here, but Mutawintji teems with the wildlife that has occupied these lands since ancient times. You might see a wedge-tailed eagle or even a peregrine falcon and enjoy the chatter of noisy short-billed correllas, zebra finches, budgerigars, apostle birds and magpies. Crossing your path may be goannas and snakes, and look out for members of the only colony in NSW of the endangered yellow-footed rock wallaby. The largest of the rock-wallabies, it is Australia’s most brightly coloured mammal – look for them on rocky ridges in the park.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001046","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Broken Hill</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 08 8080 3200<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:brokenhill.office@environment.nsw.gov.au\">brokenhill.office@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 183 Argent Street, Broken Hill NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30am, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Mutawintji National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broken Hill (130km)</li>\n<li>White Cliffs (130km)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Car</h4>\n<p>From Broken Hill</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Silver City Highway towards Tibooburra and look for the Mutawintji National Park turnoff</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Barrier Highway 75km from Broken Hill</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consult maps, GPS and local visitor centre information for travel distances, times and road conditions.</p>","car":"","public_transport":"","bike":"","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>Mutawintji National Park is best visited during spring - daytime weather is pleasant and the nights are not yet too cold.</p>\n","temperature":"\n<p>Summer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 30°C and 35°C</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded temperature in summer is 48.6°C</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winter ­</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 17°C and 21°C</li>\n<li>The area’s lowest recorded temperature in winter is -3.3°C</li>\n</ul>\n","rainfall":"\n<ul>\n<li>On average the wettest month is January, the driest month on average is September.</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded rainfall is 140.2mm in one day</li>\n</ul>"},"spatial_data":[{"type":"Marker","gid_id":"{A7907915-CCD6-4B3C-B608-2D8799E4629B}","spatial_data":"POINT (142.39393463381646 -31.115892763478257)"}],"alerts":[{"title":"Mutawintji National Park","description":"\n<strong class=\"closed-areas\">CLOSED AREAS</strong>\n<br/>\nTEST entire park closure all parks in state, now, all PWG regions selected.<br />\n(Ends  Thursday 5 December)<br />\n<strong class=\"fire-ban\">FIRE BAN</strong>\n<br />\nA <a href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/fire/totalfirebans.htm\">park fire ban</a> applies in the park.\n<br /><b>Park fire ban and restrictions for Mutawintji National Park<br /></b>A <a title=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/fire/totalfirebans.htm\" href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/fire/totalfirebans.htm\"><span title=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/fire/totalfirebans.htm\">park fire ban</span></a> is put in place at Mutawintji National Park every year between midnight, 31 October and midnight, 1 March.  No solid fuel fires (using timber, charcoal or heat beads) are permitted during this time.

Early settlers called them muttonbirds because of their fatty mutton-like flesh. The birds spend the Australian winter in southeast Asia, travelling back to Muttonbird Island in August each year. Amazingly, the birds return to the same burrow every year. A pair of birds share the responsibility of keeping one single egg warm and then share the raising of their chick. During the day they forage for food and return to their burrow just after dusk. They depart on their annual migration in late April every year.</p>\n<p><b>Giidany</b><b> Miirlarl<br></b>Muttonbird Island is a sacred and significant site to the local Gumbaynggirr Aboriginal people, who call the island Giidany Miirlarl, meaning moon sacred place. The moon is the island’s protector, guarding the muttonbirds as a food source and protecting them from over-harvesting. The island was also a ceremonial site.

Much evidence of their long connection with this Country can be seen today, including scarred trees, open campsites, burial grounds, stone arrangements, middens and rock engravings. The landscape of Myall Lakes includes important spiritual sites that are an important part of the identity of local Aboriginal people. Make sure you visit Dark Point Aboriginal Place while you’re at visiting the park. This rocky headland has been of significance to Worimi people for at least 4000 years. The clans or nuras (family groups) within the Worimi people would gather together here for ceremonies and feasts.<br></p>\n<p><b>Go fish</b><br>\nFishing is a popular activity in Myall Lakes, with catches likely to include bream, whiting, Australian salmon, flathead and mullet. There are lots of great places in the park to throw in a line, like the beaches, lakes or rivers. Try fishing from your boat or for a relaxing day on the water you could try a spot of kayak fishing.</p>\n<p><b>Enjoy the outdoors</b><br>\nLooking for things to do during the school holidays? At Myall Lakes you can go camping, boating, swimming, canoeing and fishing. And when you’ve tried all of those, you can explore the park on foot, by 4WD or bike, stopping for a spot of birdwatching or to enjoy a picnic or barbecue lunch along the way. Whatever your interests, there is bound to be something that takes your fancy.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"},{"name":"Whale watching","id":"{72F41C54-2547-4547-9148-8F1DC268CF47}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001030","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Great Lakes (Pacific Palms)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6591 0300<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> \"The Ruins\" Camping Ground, Booti Booti National Park, The Lakes Way, Pacific Palms NSW 2428<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday (closed public holidays)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001031","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nelson Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4984 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 1, 12B Teramby Road, Nelson Bay NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Myall Lakes National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hawks Nest (5km)</li>\n<li>Forster (35km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (84km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From the Pacific Highway take:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tea Gardens Road to access the <strong>Myall River</strong> and <strong>Bombah Broadwater</strong> precincts of the park</li>\n<li>Bombah Point Road to access the <strong>Boolambayte</strong> and <strong>Bombah Broadwater</strong> precincts of the park</li>\n<li>Seal Rocks Road to access the <strong>Sugarloaf Point</strong> to <strong>Shelley Beach</strong> precinct of the park</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a vehicle ferry at Bombah Point which provides access across the lake (operates 8am to 6pm daily, fees apply).

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal history<br></b>A vast area of the central west of New South Wales, including Nangar National Park, is Wiradjuri country. Evidence suggests that Nangar Range has been an important landmark in Aboriginal culture and that the surrounding area was occupied for long periods. Places of significance include archaeological sites containing artefacts, stone scatters, quarries and scar trees.</p>\n<p><b>Historic treasure<br></b>Gold was discovered around Eugowra in the 1860s, drawing miners and bushrangers, including the Gardener and Ben Hall gangs who roamed the area that the park now covers. Chinese miners lived here in the early 1900s, prospecting for copper. Historical remains in the park include remnants of gardens and orchards of Dripping Rock homestead, lost to fire in recent years, and its piggery, ruined hay shed and yards.</p>\n<p><b>An ever-changing landscape<br></b>Ranging from the undulating hills in the south of the park to the long cliff line of red siltstone on the northern boundary - and the 770m-high Mount Nangar - the park offers a great variety of landscapes and views. Terarra Creek valley is open with wide creek flats and gentle slopes and the upper tributaries of Mogong Creek contains several natural springs.</p>\n<p>You’ll see from the high vantage points of the park that the valley floor and more accessible lower slopes have been cleared by grazing and logging. Old growth forest is found in the steeper areas, but under national park protection, the park’s vegetation communities will grow ever stronger.</p>\n<p><b>A refuge for wildlife<br></b>Amid the extensive farmlands of the central west, Nangar is home to many sedentary and migratory birds and local native animals. Among many bird species are several birds of prey such as the peregrine falcon, wedge-tailed eagle and brown falcon, which use the cliff face along the northern boundary for nesting and perching.</p>\n<p>The park is also home to the eastern grey kangaroo, common wallaroo, red-necked wallaby, swamp wallaby, little mastiff-bat and chocolate wattled bat. You may also spot the southern rainbow skink, eastern long-necked tortoise and spotted grass frog.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001045","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Forbes </h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6851 4429<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Camp Street, Forbes<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Nangar National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eugowra (10km)</li>\n<li>Forbes (40km)</li>\n<li>Orange (70 km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Eugowra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel 10km along Escort Way (Eugowra – Orange Road)</li>\n<li>The park entrance sign is at the intersection with Dripping Rock Road</li>\n<li>Turn right here and travel 2.5km along Dripping Rock Road, where you’ll cross a cattle grid into the park.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Orange:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel 70km along Escort Way (otherwise known as Forbes Road)</li>\n<li>The park entrance sign is at the intersection with Dripping Rock Road</li>\n<li>Turn left here and travel 2.5km along Dripping Rock Road, where you’ll cross a cattle grid into the park.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Nangar National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Important Aboriginal heritage</b><br>\nThe Nattai area is the traditional territory of the Dharawal and Gundangarra Aboriginal peoples. The Wollondilly and Burragorang valleys historically form a transition zone between the two. The land and waterways, and the plants and animals that live in them, feature in all facets of Aboriginal culture, including recreational, ceremonial, spiritual, and as a main source of food and medicine. They are closely associated with the dreaming stories and cultural learning that are still passed on to this day.</p>\n<p><b>Wilderness adventures</b><br>\nFor the adventurous hiker, Nattai is a wilderness paradise offering rugged walking experiences rarely found so close to major cities and towns. There are several long hikes that will suit well-equipped nature lovers. Choose between a number of routes, all of them featuring incredible scenery among the sandstone cliffs, rainforest and woodlands, including Couridjah Corridor walk, Mount Jellore, Starlight’s trail, or the Nattai River trail.</p>\n<p><b>Amazing animals</b><br>\nThe incredible range of wildlife you can encounter in Nattai National Park will thrill animal-lovers. A huge variety of remote habitats support up to nine species of frogs, 160 species of birds, and 19 species of reptiles; not to mention, wallaroos, emus, swamp wallabies, grey kangaroos, dingoes, wombats, echidnas, forest microbats, gliders, and wallaroos. Among the threatened species you may see are brush-tailed rock wallabies, long-nosed potoroos, tiger quolls, powerful owls, and glossy black cockatoos.</p>\n<p><b>See the forest through the trees</b><br>\nNattai is a wonderful place to revel in the beauty of Australian land, thanks to its incredible range of environments, from exposed sandstone plateau tops to wild rainforest and sheltered gorges. Stroll among eucalyptus trees, pockets of blue-leaved stringybark forest and, on the Nattai River, majestic stands of Nattai Sandstone River peppermint forest.  In the northern part of the park, you’ll find communities of red bloodwood, Sydney blackbutt, red ironbark, scribbly gum, Sydney peppermint, and smooth-barked apple trees.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001019","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Picton</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4640 0500<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 99 Menangle Street, Picton NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Nattai National Park  is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mittagong (33km)</li>\n<li>Picton (43km)</li>\n<li>Sydney CBD (130km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Thirlmere Lakes National Park:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vehicle access points are located at Wollondilly lookout off Wombeyan Caves Road (follow Wombeyan Caves Road from Mittagong heading west for approx 30km) and off Wattle Ridge Road (turn off Wilson Drive at Hill Top onto Coates Road then Wattle Ridge Road and follow for approx 7km).</li>\n</ul>\n<br><p>From Mittagong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go south on Old Hume Highway for 5.6km and then onto Hume Highway/State Route 31.</li>\n<li>After 1.6 km, take the exit towards Cole Vale, then the first exit onto Church Avenue.</li>\n<li>After 5,8km, turn left towards West Parade, and then right onto West Parade.</li>\n<li>Keep going onto Wattle Ridge Road and after 7.5km, take a slight left onto Natai Road.

Discover the ancient Antarctic beech forests below the escarpment edge on trails like the Lyrebird or the Eagles Nest walking tracks.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b><br>\nThe park straddles the traditional boundaries of the Dunghutti, Anaiwan and Gumbaynggirr people, and covers an area of great spiritual and cultural significance to local Aboriginals. Point lookout in particular is a sacred location, known to Aboriginal people as ‘Berarngutta’, which roughly translates as 'prohibited area'. It is considered a men-only place, and today many Aboriginal women choose to continue this tradition and avoid visiting the area.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b><br>\nIn 2010, New England National Park celebrated its 75th anniversary as one of NSW’s most iconic parks. Its history is a testament to the vision and dedication of several influential New Englanders, notably Philip A Wright and his son Peter.  They were deeply impressed by the beauty and grandeur of Point lookout and recognised the value of the area as a sanctuary for plants and animals. After you see the spectacular views at Point lookout, take a moment to learn about the history of the park and the visionary people behind its conservation.</p>\n<p><b>Amazing wildlife</b><br>\nThe park’s altitudinal range, from 150m above sea level to 1563m, makes it a superb habitat for a diversity of wildlife. You might see kangaroos, wallabies, gliders, possums and the inquisitive spotted-tailed quoll. Adults and children alike will love watching the resident lyrebird at Banksia Point. Yet with over 100 species of birds in the park, there are plenty of opportunities for birdwatching. You might spot white-throated tree creepers and rufous fantails in the open forests, while in winter flowering banksias attract Lewins honeyeaters and eastern spinebills.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001040","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Dorrigo Rainforest Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6657 2309<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Dorrigo Rainforest Centre, Dome Road, Dorrigo NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday, 9:00am-4:30pm weekends, (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>New England National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ebor (25km)</li>\n<li>Dorrigo (72km)</li>\n<li>Armidale (81km)</li>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (136km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Dorrigo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel west along Waterfall Way towards Armidale</li>\n<li>Turn left and continue through the township of Ebor</li>\n<li>After Ebor, turn left to stay on Waterfall Way heading towards Armidale.</li>\n<li>After about 7.6km, turn left onto Point Lookout Road which continues until the park entrance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Armidale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel east along Waterfall Way towards Ebor and Dorrigo</li>\n<li>About 7.6km before the township of Ebor, turn left onto Point Lookout Road which continues until the park entrance.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a></p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in New England National Park.

Historically, Aboriginal People found sustenance in the area and used it for ritual purposes; it continues to play an important role in the communities today. “Our Aboriginal cultural heritage is alive and strong,” say Gumbaynggirr Aboriginal Elders.</p>\n<p><b>Rolling coastal rainforest<br></b>Ngambaa's coastal foothills include large areas of old-growth grey gum and spotted gum forest of significant conservation value. Not only does it have one of the highest ironbark diversities on record, it also provides forest connectivity from the coast to the hinterland to the escarpment. This is crucial for local wildlife.</p>\n<p><b>Some powerful residents<br></b>One example is the powerful owl, Australia’s largest owl and an elusive predator. Ngambaa offers crucial habitat for these birds – they can survive only where large areas of forest provide nest sites and an extensive hunting range filled with possums and gliders. One breeding pair can command up to 1,000ha, which makes them very difficult to spot. Nevertheless, bring your camera just in case.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001039","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coffs Harbour</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6652 0900<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 32 Marina Drive, Coffs Harbour NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Ngambaa Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kempsey (23km)</li>\n<li>Macksville (27km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Kempsey:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north on Pacific Highway to Fredrickton, then turn left onto Collombatti Road.</li>\n<li>Follow Collombatti Road, then Range Road, then Buds Crossing Road, which leads you into the reserve.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Ngambaa Nature Reserve is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.<br></p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Ngambaa Nature Reserve.

They are a living link to the environment of ancient Australia and give us insight into the environment of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana. This lush and diverse conservation area protects a number of vulnerable and threatened species such as the rufous scrub bird, red goshawk, sooty and masked owls and regent bowerbirds. It is also home to the recently discovered nightcap oak, which can grow up to 40m high.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal heritage</b><br>\nNightcap National Park is the traditional land of the Bundjalung People, in particular the Widjabul People who have inhabited the area for thousands of years. The park contains many ancient sites of cultural significance, including ceremonial and sacred sites that are still used by local Aboriginal People today. The creeks, plants, animals and landscape of the park feature in the stories, teachings and practices of Aboriginal People that continue to be passed on today.</p>\n<p><b>Frogs galore</b><br>\nThe rainforest creeks in Nightcap National Park are home to a number of threatened frogs, including Fleay’s barred frog and the masked mountain frog. You might see Fleay’s barred frogs hiding under leaf litter near streams or foraging for food on the rainforest floor, but you’re more likely to hear their chorus, a distinctive ‘arrrrrrk’. This rare frog feeds mainly on insects and invertebrates, so crickets, moths and beetles make a good meal. Keep your eyes open for this pale brown frog around Terania creek at the base of Protesters falls.</p>\n<p><b>History buffs</b><br>\nNightcap National Park contains a number of sites of historical interest, including a flying fox on the Googarna track. The flying fox was used to lower logs 500m down to the Kunghur mill during the 1940s and 1950s. The historic Nightcap track provided the first bridle track and telegraph line between the Richmond and Tweed valleys in the 1870s, and today you can explore this track on foot, camping overnight in the bush.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001041","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Lismore/Alstonville</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6627 0200<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:northernrivers.region@environment.nsw.gov.au\">northernrivers.region@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Colonial Arcade, 75 Main Street, Alstonville NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Nightcap National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lismore (35km)</li>\n<li>Mullumbimby (35km)</li>\n<li>Nimbin (25km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Lismore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive 35km to the northern rivers area of NSW</li>\n<li>Road access is from one of five roads from the Richmond Valley in the south, four of which are unsealed</li>\n<li>Whian Whian Forest Drive is off the Lismore-Mullumbimby Road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle info website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Nightcap National Park.

The park’s landscape provided a rich source of food, medicine and shelter for Aboriginal people and features strongly in cultural knowledge and Dreaming stories. As you travel through this park, take some time to think about the people who lived here and their strong attachment to this ancient landscape and all it contains.</p>\n<p><b>Waterworld</b><br>\nThe Nymbodia River is a true highlight of Nymboi-Binderay National Park. The name of the park comes from Aboriginal language of the local Gumbaynggirr people; “Nymboi” being their name for the river, and “Binderay” meaning river. Rafting down the Nymboi River with an expert guide is an exhilarating experience and a fantastic way to take in the park’s landscape.</p>\n<p><b>Animal kingdom</b><br>\nNymboi-Binderlay has a diverse range of animals, including 68 types of mammal, 25 kinds of amphibian, 33 sorts of reptile and over 120 bird species; of these, at least 15 species are threatened. When you’re picnicking, camping or walking through the tallowwood and coachwood rainforests, be sure to keep your eyes open for the many native animals which call this place home.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001040","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Dorrigo Rainforest Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6657 2309<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">Dorrigo.RainforestCentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Dorrigo Rainforest Centre, Dome Road, Dorrigo NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday, 9:00am-4:30pm weekends, (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001038","contact_details_full":"<h3>Grafton</h3>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6641 1500<br />\n<strong>Fax:</strong> 02 6641 1599<br />\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br />\n<strong>Street address:</strong> Level 4, 49 Victoria Street, Grafton NSW<br />\n<strong>Postal address:</strong> PO Box 361, Grafton NSW 2460<br />\n<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>"}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Nymboi-Binderay National Park is near:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nymboida (10km)</li>\n<li>Dorrigo (25km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (50km)</li>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (68km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Nymboida travel south for 2km, and turn left into Laytons Range Road.

The protected wilderness of Nymboida offers a spectacular landscape for you to explore, formed by ancient volcanoes and long periods of faulting and uplift. You’ll discover rugged and remote valleys, the pristine waters of the Nymboida and Mann rivers, and magnificent towering forest.</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b> <br>\nThis region covers parts of the traditional lands of the Ngarrabul and Gumbaynggirr people. Evidence of past occupation includes open campsites along the Mann and Nymboida River terraces, and local Aboriginal people maintain strong links with this special country.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage</b> <br>\nThe challenging territory of the Nymboida has seen plenty of settler activity over the years. Generations of families mustered on large, rugged bush blocks on the Nymboida and Mann rivers, sometimes camping in slab huts, and miners of tin and gold worked Nymboida and Chambigne Creek Goldfield along Mann River valley.</p>\n<p><b>As nature intended<br></b>The core of Nymboida National Park has been declared wilderness and is sliced up by the rugged Mann River. The Bindery-Mann Wilderness, along with the adjacent Washpool Wilderness, forms a large area where nature survives away from direct human interference. This bushland connects with the Gibraltar Range-Washpool section of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia.</p>\n<p><b>An important habitat for animals and birdlife<br></b>Search the skies for the majestic white-bellied sea eagle, listen out for the magical call of bellbirds, and rest your paddle while you search for turtles and water dragons. Look beneath the surface of the river for fish, but pay close attention to fishing regulations – the park’s rivers contain part of the only remaining wild breeding population of the critically endangered eastern freshwater cod. It is illegal to catch them and other seasonal fishing restrictions also apply.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001038","contact_details_full":"<h3>Grafton</h3>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6641 1500<br />\n<strong>Fax:</strong> 02 6641 1599<br />\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br />\n<strong>Street address:</strong> Level 4, 49 Victoria Street, Grafton NSW<br />\n<strong>Postal address:</strong> PO Box 361, Grafton NSW 2460<br />\n<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>"},{"contact":"20071105000001036","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Glen Innes</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6739 0700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 68 Church Street, Glen Innes NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Nymboida National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grafton (51km)</li>\n<li>Glen Innes (150km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>To reach Nymboida River campground from Grafton (4WD required):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel west along the Gwydir Highway through Ramornie village to Ramornie Forest Road, 23.5km from the South Grafton roundabout.</li>\n<li>Follow this road through Ramornie National Park and on to Nymboida National Park and Nymboida River campground, a further 28km.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternative route from Grafton via Old Glen Innes-Grafton Road (4WD required):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel west along the Gwydir Highway from Grafton, and turn south onto Old Glen Innes Road 8km from Grafton.</li>\n<li>Travel along Old Glen Innes Road a further 32km to the top of the Buccarumbi Range</li>\n<li>Turn north onto Doboy Road, travelling a further 24km to Nymboida National Park and Nymboida River campground.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To enter Nymboida National Park on canoe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Join Nymboida River at Buccarumbi, 40km southwest of Grafton on Old Glen Innes-Grafton Road.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Nymboida National Park.

Here are some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Land of the Wiradjuri<br></b>This land represents a very important food-gathering region for the local Wiradjuri People. Aboriginal sites, including scarred trees, ovens and stone artefacts, can be found throughout the park.</p>\n<p><b>Flying high<br></b>An incredible world of birds can be discovered at Oolambeyan National Park. The park was established to protect the plains-wanderer, however these elusive birds are very rare. Easier to spot are interesting woodland varieties – the yellow-rumped thornbill, superb fairy wren, red-capped robin and apostlebird – common around the homestead picnic area. Get your binoculars out if you fancy spotting a raptor. Wedge-tailed eagles are one of the most notable species you’ll find here, building their nests in white cypress pines across the park, but you may also spy black kites and brown goshawks.</p>\n<p><b>Wild plains<br></b>As well as birds, Oolambeyan is home to many species of animals. Around the old homestead, you’re likely to spy the kangaroos – red kangaroos and eastern and western grey kangaroos – that reside here. During the heat of the day, they often rest under the boree trees, although they also graze on the short grass of the oval.

Here are just a few to spark your imagination:</p>\n<p><strong>Ancient lands</strong><br>\nOxley Wild Rivers National Park is part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area. The park contains some of the best examples of dry rainforest communities in Australia.</p>\n<p>When you are out exploring the wet and dry eucalypt forests, grassy woodlands and heathlands of the park, look for native olives, lacebarks, shiny-leaved and giant stinging trees, shatterwoods, scentless rosewoods and red kamalas.</p>\n<p><strong>Rock hoppers</strong><br>\nThe varied plant communities of the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park provide a home for 350 animal species, including the largest confirmed population of brush tailed rock wallabies. Even though there are roughly 10,000 of this endangered species in the park, you’ll have to keep your eyes open to catch a glimpse of their bushy tail. Look for them jumping around rocky escarpments and granite outcrops or grazing on native grasses at dawn and dusk.</p>\n<p><strong>Jaw-dropping scenery</strong><br>\nWith dramatic ridges and gorges, towering rock outcrops and beautiful rivers and waterfalls, there is something new around every corner and you’ll be constantly amazed by the views. The sight of a majestic wedge-tailed eagle soaring high above the gorges looking for food is a truly spectacular sight to behold. Don’t forget your camera, give yourself plenty of time and keep your eyes open.</p>\n<p><strong>A national first</strong><br>\nAside from spectacular scenery and abundant wildlife, the park also contains important historical sites, including the remains of Australia’s first commercial hydro-electric scheme. It was constructed at Gara Gorge between 1893 and 1894 to power the town and gold mines of nearby Hillgrove. Take a walk along the Threlfall Historic walk to get a close up view of this historic site.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001035","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Armidale (local office)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6738 9100     <br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 145 Miller Street, Armidale<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001037","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Walcha</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6777 4700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 188W North Street, Walcha NSW 2354<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Oxley Wild Rivers National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Armidale (18km)</li>\n<li>Walcha (20km)</li>\n<li>Dorrigo (80km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Walcha and Armidale there are numerous turnoffs along the Waterfall Way and Oxley Highway.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal heritage<br></b>It was probably around 13,000 years ago that Aboriginal people first moved into this area. Until European settlement, these people lived off and nurtured the land and a large number of Aboriginal sites have been recorded within Parr. Mount Yengo (originally Yango), in adjoining <a title=\"Yengo National Park\" href=\"http://http//www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/yengo-national-park\">Yengo National Park</a>, is of particular significance; it was the place from which Biamie left the earth after creating the world, flattening the top with his foot as he went. Many sites within Parr, Yengo and the surrounding regions are closely connected with this mountain. Today, the local Aboriginal community retains a strong and active interest in the management of these sites and the landscape, along with a desire to preserve, as well as revive, Aboriginal culture.</p>\n<p><b>Convict trail<br></b>This area was named after William Parr, who was one of the earliest European explorers of overland northern routes out of Sydney. A draughtsman, boat builder and mineralogist, Parr was transported on the <i>Fortune</i> in 1813 at the age of 39, having been convicted of forgery. Despite a 14-year sentence, Governor Macquarie quickly made use of his skills and soon assigned him to the Surveyor General’s department as a mineral surveyor. In October 1817, Parr and his party set off from Windsor to find a trafficable route from the Hawkesbury to Hunter River, but did not quite reach Hunter Valley. Early European transport routes between Sydney and Hunter Valley are evident within Parr State Conservation Area, with remnants of Putty Road/Old Bulga Road. Today, Parr conserves Webb Creek catchment.</p>\n<p><b>Extraordinary plants<br></b>Parr contains an unusual mix of plant species which are not only different from those growing further north in <a title=\"Yengo National Park\" href=\"http://http//www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/yengo-national-park\">Yengo National Park</a>, but are normally found in completely different parts of NSW. Vegetation ranges from open woodlands along the dry ridges to communities of open forest and tall open forest, heathlands, mallee and sedgelands.

On your exploration of the park, you may see stone tools, grinding grooves, modified trees, and rock art. Find out more about the Gamilaroi people and their ancient culture on a guided tour of Sandstone Caves, a place containing Aboriginal rock art and engravings.</p>\n<p><b>Birdwatcher’s paradise<br></b>Pilliga Forest is a mixture of eastern and western climates, making it very attractive to birds – more than 230 species have been recorded. You’re bound to see some of that range during your time at the park, and if you keep a close eye out and bring some binoculars, you’re definitely see even more. Pilliga is one of the few places left in NSW where you can catch sight of the grey-crowned babbler. It’s a bird that lives in family groups and roost together in domed nests of sticks. Other birds you may see include glossy black cockatoos, brown treecreepers, regent honeyeaters, barking owls, and red-capped robins. For more information about great birdwatching opportunities in Pilliga, be sure to pick up a copy of Bird Routes of Baradine from <a href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/pilliga-national-park/pilliga-forest-discovery-centre/tourist-information\">Pilliga Forest Discovery Centre</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Koala territory<br></b>Pilliga Forest supports a vast number of mammals, including swamp wallabies, eastern grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies, and eastern pygmy possums. Pilliga also has the largest koala population in NSW to the west of the Great Dividing Range – look for them in the forest’s red gums and the Pilliga box.

If you’re an avid birdwatcher, you might catch glimpses of glossy black cockatoos and masked owls in the park’s tall forests and wet gullies.

The fruit dove's deep, repeated ‘<i>whoop whoop</i>’ call is often heard high up in the trees of thick forest.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Historic rainforest<br></b>The dense rainforest you’ll find at Robertson Nature Reserve once covered 2500ha of the red basalt soil area around Robertson. The Yarrawa Brush, or ‘Brush’, as it was called by the early explorers who were trying to forge a route from the highlands to the coast, was first penetrated by Charles Throsby in 1817.  However, the area was not significantly cleared until the 1860s, when settlement around Robertson began. But by the early 1900s, more than 80 per cent of the Yarrawa Brush was gone. Today, only about 500ha of fragmented patches survive, making Robertson Nature Reserve a special window into the past as well as an important place for conservation.</p>\n<p><b>Natural wonders<br></b>Robertson Nature Reserve is a tiny 5.3ha reserve, but it’s packed with natural wonders. It conserves one of the largest and least disturbed areas of rainforest remaining from the Yarrawa Brush. Step inside this dense cool or warm temperate rainforest and you’ll find unique shrubs, soft tree ferns, numerous vines and intricate fungi. Look up into the canopy at trees like sassafras, featherwood, coachwood and possum wood. Watch for the flashes of crimson rosellas darting through the trees or listen for the whip crack call of the eastern whipbird.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001060","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4887 7270<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Morton National Park, Nowra Road, Fitzroy Falls NSW 2577<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Robertson Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robertson (0.5km)</li>\n<li>Moss Vale (22km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (45km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Moss Vale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel east along Illawarra Highway towards Robertson</li>\n<li>Once in the township of Robertson, turn right onto Meryla Street.</li>\n<li>Follow to the end then turn left onto South Street</li>\n<li>Continue until you see the sign on your right</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Wollongong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel west along Illawarra Highway towards Robertson</li>\n<li>Once in the township of Robertson, turn left onto Meryla Street.</li>\n<li>Follow to the end then turn left onto South Street</li>\n<li>Continue until you see the sign on your right</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options to Robertson, visit the <a title=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Robertson Nature Reserve.

Spanning Port Hacking to Helensburgh, the park features multiple entry points and is well signposted, though it’s always a good idea to take a Royal National Park map.</p>\n<p><b>A date with history</b> <br>\nWhen exploring Royal National Park you can see a range of Aboriginal sites and artefacts. The best way to find out more about Aboriginal cultural heritage in the park is on a tour with an Aboriginal Discovery Ranger. You might also spot one of the 80 historic remnants from the park’s Victorian-era establishment, including ornamental trees and residential remains.</p>\n<p><b>Home to the feathered and furry</b> <br>\nMany visitors regularly spot native wildlife in the Hacking River Valley area, so keep an eye out for possums, sugar gliders and wallabies. This Sydney park is also home to a huge number of bats, amphibians and reptiles. Plus, birdwatchers are in luck – over 300 bird species have been recorded here, look out for sulphur-crested cockatoos, crimson rosellas, yellow-tailed black cockatoos and rainbow lorikeets.</p>\n<p><b>A place to get active</b> <br>\nWho needs a gym? At Royal National Park you can hike, swim and row to your heart’s content. Hire a paddleboat from the Audley boatshed or surf the renowned Garie Beach. Jog along sandstone cliffs, attempt over 100km of walking tracks or try mountain biking the East Heathcote trails (be sure to note the ‘no sign–no ride’ policy).</p>\n<p><b>Exceptional environments</b> <br>\nThe park was one of Australia’s first areas of land set aside for conservation. In this natural haven, open ocean, sandstone cliffs and wetlands meet grassy woodland, rainforests, coastal heathland and eucalypt forests. You’ll also find some significant geological sites, including fascinating beach ridges at Cabbage Tree Basin.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20080401155936219","contact_details_full":"<h3>Royal National Park office</h3>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9542 0648<br />\n<strong>Street address:</strong> 159 Farnell Avenue, Royal National Park, NSW<br />\n<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:30pm, Monday to Friday (closed public holidays)</p>"}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Royal National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cronulla (1km by ferry)</li>\n<li>Sutherland (2km)</li>\n<li>Parramatta (30km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (32km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (40km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Royal National Park's main entry points are along the Princes Highway</li>\n<li>Turn off the highway at either Farnell Avenue, just south of Loftus, or at McKell Avenue at Waterfall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Wollongong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can reach the park along the Princes Highway, or via Otford, north of Stanwell Park.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For up to date traffic information we recommend people visit <a title=\"www.livetraffic.com\" href=\"http://www.livetraffic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.livetraffic.com</a>.</p>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"http://www.131500.com.au/\" href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/\">NSW transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p><!-- EktFileStoreMetaData=C:\\DOCUME~1\\guzmana\\Local Settings\\Temp\\clip_image001.png#*#external link#*#2 -->","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>Royal National Park covers a wide range of landscapes, from open grassland to ocean-fronting clifftops.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>The Australian story<br></b>Scheyville has a rich heritage that gives us a great insight into the past 175 years of Australian history. It has played host to a government cooperative farm and an agricultural training facility. In World War I, it was an internment camp, in World War II, a training base for the First Australian Parachute Battalion. It’s also been a migrant camp for new Australians and an officer’s training unit in the Vietnam War. Scheyville has seen it all. And its remarkable life continues too: around a quarter of a million Australians are linked to the Scheyville site through their ancestors. Because of this, Scheyville is recognised by the NSW State Heritage Register.</p>\n<p><b>Putting down roots<br></b>Scheyville National Park protects a large area of the Cumberland Plain Woodland, an endangered ecological community. There’s also a small area of Casltlereagh scribbly gum woodland and shale transition forest. Strolling through Scheyville has much to interest naturalists – and animal enthusiasts, for that matter. The native thorn bush is an important understory habitat for birds. There are over 140 types of waterbirds, offering superb birdwatching opportunities. There are horse riding tracks and places for cycling. There is even an education centre focusing on plants and animals.</p>\n<p><b>Feathered migrants<br></b>The park sustains an impressive population of permanent and migratory birds, including several precious species like the vulnerable swift parrot and turquoise parrot, and the endangered regent honeyeater. Bring some comfortable shoes and a pair of binoculars to get the most out of this quiet landscape, which changes throughout the year as different species come and go.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001010","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Windsor</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4572 3100<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Scheyville National Park, Scheyville Road, Scheyville NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Scheyville National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windsor (8.2km)</li>\n<li>Parramatta (31km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (45km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Parramatta:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north-west on Windsor Road to Boundary Road, Vineyard (6km east of Windsor)</li>\n<li>Turn north onto Boundary Road , and then west on Old Pitt Town Road.</li>\n<li>Turn north-east on Scheyville Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Windsor:</p>\n<p>Take Windsor Road and turn east onto Pitt Town Road, then onto Saunders Road, then Scheyville Road.</p>\n<p>There are numerous gates where walkers can enter the park, with the entrance for vehicles being on Scheyville Road.</p>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW transport info website\" href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Scheyville National Park.

The park is also the occasional home to koalas which feed on the eucalypts along the western boundary.

Listen out for the honking magpie goose and head to Seaham Swamp Bird Hide and see how many others you can spot. And don’t forget your camera – you’re sure to get some terrific photos.</p>\n<p><b>A rich Aboriginal heritage<br></b>The reserve lies within the area of the Worimi Local Aboriginal Land Council. In years gone by, it and the adjoining Williams River would have provided important resources to Aboriginal residents, such as waterfowl and fish. Looking at the reserve’s abundant melaleucas today, it’s fascinating to think those very trees would have delivered paperbark for cooking, while other barks may have been used for coolamons and other wooden implements.</p>\n<p><b>Incredible geology<br></b>Interested in natural history? The reserve protects Seaham Quarry, a historic site containing scientifically important sediments from ancient glacial thaw water. These sediments date back 90 -120 million years, and the quarry was dedicated for preservation in 1925 for scientific purposes. Check out the remarkable streaky rock and read the notice from Professor Edgeworth David, the pioneering geologist and explorer who first recognised the sediments’ glacigene origin in 1914.</p>\n<p><b>A colonial cottage<br></b>Seaham Swamp Nature Reserve is also home to a historic slab cottage known as Tom McLellan’s Cottage, or simply Tom’s Cottage. Come see a fine example of a typical colonial era rural dwelling which was moved to its current location in the early 1900s. Though it’s named for Tom, the cottage was actually first built as a retirement home for his mother, Mary McLellan.</p>\n<p><b>Important habitats<br></b>You may well see a grey kangaroo or eastern snake-necked turtle on your visit, as well as many wonderful birds. The reserve provides important habitats for a range of creatures on both wet and dry land. Roam the woodlands to see mighty ironbark and forest red gums and spot birds aplenty roosting in broad-leaved paperbarks. Some of these habitats are sadly under pressure, but revegetation is underway thanks to Seaham Primary School students.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001031","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nelson Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4984 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 1, 12B Teramby Road, Nelson Bay NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Seaham Swamp Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seaham (2km)</li>\n<li>Raymond Terrace (14km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (40km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the F3 Freeway towards Newcastle</li>\n<li>When you reach the roundabout at Black Hill, take the third exit onto John Renshaw Drive, still heading towards Newcastle.</li>\n<li>Exit onto Anderson Drive towards Woodberry/Beresfield, then turn right to stay on Anderson Drive. </li>\n<li>Take the first left onto Woodberry Road, then turn right to stay on Woodberry Road.</li>\n<li>At the roundabout, take the second exit onto Raymond Terrace Road. </li>\n<li>After about 4km, turn left onto Seaham Road, which turns into Warren Street.</li>\n<li>Seaham Swamp Nature Reserve is located on the corner of Warren and Torrence streets</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Seaham Swamp Nature Reserve.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>The park’s beach, forest and wetland environments near Coomonderry Swamp were once important sources of food and materials for Aboriginal people. Part of the Dharawal language group, they had strong associations with other groups north to Sydney, inland to the southern highlands and south as far as Gippsland in Victoria. Today, you can see shell middens along the length of the foredune and in the forest. There are also several important ceremonial and culturally significant sites for Aboriginal people within the park.</p>\n<p><b>Aviation history</b> <br>\nSir Charles Kingsford Smith started his historic 1933 trans-Tasman flight to New Plymouth in New Zealand from Seven Mile Beach. This flight led to the inauguration of the trans-Tasman airmail service, making Seven Mile Beach a significant place in aviation history. In November 1933, Kingsford Smith ran passenger flights from the beach and in 1934, he used it for an emergency landing.</p>\n<p><b>It’s a wild world<br></b>For animal-lovers, Seven Mile Beach National Park has lots to offer. There are great birdwatching opportunities in the tall forests and at Coomonderry Swamp. Rainbow lorikeets, king parrots, and rosellas can all be seen, whilst thornbills, wrens, New Holland honeyeaters and brown cuckoo doves are also in abundance. There are also plenty of small mammals to see, such as antechinus and a range of tree-dwelling mammal species. As you wander through the forests, keep your eyes out for the greater gliders found in the park. Gliders are best seen at night, so be sure to enquire about a spotlight walk with NPWS Discovery Ranger.<br><br><b>Unique landscape<br></b>This park supports several significant and endangered natural habitats. The forests are one of the last intact areas of Bangalay and blackbutt sand dune forest on the south coast. Coomonderry Swamp is also the only large semi-permanent freshwater wetland on the south coast. The area is significant as it shows a relatively intact example of a large scale dune barrier formed during the end of the last ice age, approximately 6000 years ago.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001190","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nowra</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4423 2170<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 55 Graham Street, Nowra NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Seven Mile Beach National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Gerroa (4km)</li>\n<li>Berry (10km)</li>\n<li>Gerringong (10km)</li>\n<li>Kiama (20km)</li>\n<li>Nowra (25km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (60km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (140km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney or Wollongong:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Turn off the Princes Highway to Gerringong</li>\n<li>Drive south through Gerroa to reach the park</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Nowra:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Turn right off the Princes Highway at Bolong Road in Bomaderry</li>\n<li>Follow Bolong Road which becomes Gerroa Road to reach the park</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Seven Mile Beach National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><strong>Aboriginal culture and heritage<br></strong>The landforms, creatures and plants of Sherwood continue to have cultural significance for the Gumbaynggir People. Plants found in the rainforest such as figs, rosella leaves, tamarinds, ginger fruit and wombat berries are important for local cultural knowledge. There are also many special Aboriginal sites in the reserve, like Woolgoolga Creek, which is important for Gumbaynggir Women. This gives visitors a fascinating insight into Aboriginal culture and heritage.</p>\n<p><strong>Changing landscapes<br></strong>Early settlers began logging here in the 1800s, and this continued right up to 1961, when it was prohibited. In 1907, they built a tramline to take timber to the mill in Woolgoolga. In the early 1900s, banana plantations were established and from the 1960s, parts of the rainforest were cleared for plantations of flooded gums and bunya pines, some of which you can still see today. Along Falls walking track, you may also see remnants of a pipeline, built in 1966 to take water from Woolgoolga Creek Falls to Woolgoolga township.</p>\n<p><strong>Precious plant life<br></strong>Sherwood Nature Reserve protects one of the few subtropical lowland floodplain rainforests remaining on the NSW North Coast, as well as dry and warm temperate rainforest and old-growth forest. A highlight is the magnificent stand of blue quandong around Woolgoolga Creek, with its whitish trunk covered in lichen and large buttresses. You might also spot the giant climbing orchid, the only known climbing orchid in Australia.</p>\n<p><strong>Birdwatching paradise<br></strong>Birdwatchers will find an incredible diversity of birdlife at Sherwood.  Wander through the rainforest on a spring or summer morning and you’ll see and hear up to 30 different species. It’s home to white-eared monarch and other common species like yellow-throated scrub wren, rufous fantail, little shrike thrush, noisy pita and log runner. It’s also an important place for threatened migratory pigeons such as the rose-crowned fruit dove and wompoo fruit dove.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001039","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coffs Harbour</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6652 0900<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 32 Marina Drive, Coffs Harbour NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001038","contact_details_full":"<h3>Grafton</h3>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6641 1500<br />\n<strong>Fax:</strong> 02 6641 1599<br />\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br />\n<strong>Street address:</strong> Level 4, 49 Victoria Street, Grafton NSW<br />\n<strong>Postal address:</strong> PO Box 361, Grafton NSW 2460<br />\n<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>"}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Sherwood Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Woolgoolga (4km)</li>\n<li>Glenreagh (7km)</li>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (28km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (60km)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n","car":"\n<p>From Woolgoolga:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn west at the Pullen Street roundabout in Woolgoolga, which later becomes Woolgoolga Creek Road.</li>\n<li>Follow for approximately 3km until the end of the bitumen road</li>\n<li>Turn left at the junction with Gentle Annie Road to reach Woolgoolga Creek picnic area</li>\n<li>To explore the reserve, continue driving along Gentle Annie Road.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Sherwood Nature Reserve is accessible by bus from Coffs Harbour to Woolgoolga, followed by a 4km walk.

South East Forests National Park and the surrounding area provided a diverse food source of animals and fish, a rich resource for weapon and tool construction, as well as a source of medicines and transport. The park protects a number of Aboriginal sites and remains an important landscape for Aboriginal people today.</p>\n<p><b>Wildlife Haven<br></b>Koalas, powerful owls and giant burrowing frogs are among the threatened species protected within South East Forests National Park. The park also shelters the state’s only known populations of endangered long-footed potoroos. Head to White Rock picnic area and look for small conical pits in the ground – evidence of a potoroo’s night-time search for fungus. If you're camping overnight at Six Mile Creek or Nunnock campgrounds, listen and watch for nocturnal creatures like gliders and possums.<br><br><b>Rock on<br></b>South East Forests National Park protects unique physical features that are sure to appeal to budding geologists, keen photographers and nature-lovers alike. The huge granite tors at Pheasants Peak are the result of volcanic activity and millions of years of weathering and erosion. For a close up view, take the challenging Pheasants Peak walk, you’ll also be rewarded with stunning views towards the Snowy Mountains and down the south coast escarpment. Don’t miss the elliptically shaped Jingera complex at Jingera Rock near the town of Wyndham; a sheer syenite rockface that is the first reported complex of its type in Australia.<br><br><b>Old-growth<br></b>In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, explorers, miners, squatters and timber getters led the way into the area that is now South East Forests National Park. The forests within the park were utilised as resources for many years up until the 1980’s when their transition to national park commenced. The old-growth forest contains eucalypt trees in their final cycle of growth; trees that provide many different types of nest or home sites for wildlife. Some animals, like large forest owls and glider possums depend on these forests for hollows that develop over long periods of time. Rutherfords Creek picnic area in the northern part of the park is a good place to see old growth forests. Take the boardwalk across the creek and you'll be dwarfed by the towering old growth forest.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001022","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bombala</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6458 4080<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 153 Maybe Street, Bombala NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-12:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001061","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Merimbula</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6495 5000<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:FSCR@environment.nsw.gov.au\">FSCR@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Corner Sapphire Coast and Merimbula Drives, Merimbula NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday and some weekends during peak holiday periods</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001023","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Narooma</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4476 0800<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Cnr Graham & Burrawang Sts, Narooma NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>South East Forests National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Merimbula (19km)</li>\n<li>Bombala (20km)</li>\n<li>Bega (25km)</li>\n<li>Eden (25km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>There are many access points for South East Forests National Park and directions will vary depending on which part of the park you would like to visit.

Here are a few to begin with:</p>\n<p><b>Diverse landscapes</b><br>\nImmerse yourself in nature at Sydney Harbour National Park. Exploring its varied scenery, you’ll find everything from sandstone cliffs and rocky foreshores to quiet beaches and bushland. Stand beneath gigantic Sydney red gums and Port Jackson figs or absorb the sheer size of the harbour from a headland lookout.</p>\n<p><b>An island paradise</b><br>\nThe park protects five historic harbour islands. Discover the rich convict and maritime heritage of Goat Island, along with stunning views from all angles. Why not picnic at Rodd or Shark Island? Set aside for public enjoyment as early as 1879, both offer picnic areas, beaches and paths for you to explore. Head to Clark Island for an Aboriginal cultural experience and enjoy the city lights as you dine on Fort Denison.<br></p>\n<p><b>A world of history</b><br>\nA number of places in the park have strong links to Sydney’s history. You'll find buildings constructed using convict labour, maritime and military fortifications, and the Quarantine Station which once housed new boat arrivals to Sydney, protecting Sydneysiders from infectious disease. You'll also find many Aboriginal sites like rock engravings and middens – examples of an ancient and enduring cultural heritage and a record of the Eora peoples’ connection to Country.</p>\n<p><b>Harbourside recreation</b><br>\nThe park’s exceptional landscapes are the perfect setting for fishing, swimming, scuba diving and soaking up the views. Sydney Harbour National Park is beloved by landscape photographers, so why not bring your camera and take a few shots? There are enough picnic spots, walking tracks and heritage sites to keep you coming back again and again.</p>\n<p><b>Native birds and animals</b><br>\nYou’ll probably spot at least one of the park’s 150 bird species on your visit, like a white-bellied sea eagle or a new-holand honeyeater. If you’re near Manly, you may be lucky enough to glimpse an endangered little penguins as it is the state’s only known mainland colony. If you happen to see unusual webbed footprints on a beach or shoreline, they may well belong to a native water rat looking for seafood in shallow water close to the shoreline.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001013","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Vaucluse</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9337 5511<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Greycliffe House, Nielsen Park, Vaucluse NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00-5:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001012","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Mosman</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9960 6266<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Governors Road, Middle Head, Mosman NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Sydney Harbour National Park is in the heart of Sydney with precincts that are close to Manly, Mosman, Vaucluse, Watsons Bay and Seaforth.</p>\n<div id=\"carDirections\"></div>","car":"\n<p>Get directions to key locations in Sydney Harbour National Park:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?daddr=Bradley's-Head-Amphitheatre,-Bradleys-Head-Road,-Mosman,-New-South-Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Bradleys-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?daddr=Dobroyd-Scenic-Drive,-Balgowlah-Heights,-New-South-Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Dobroyd-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?daddr=Old-Fort-Road,-Mosman,-New-South-Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Middle-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?daddr=Nielsen-Park,-Greycliffe-Avenue,-Vaucluse,-New-South-Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Nielsen-Park</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?daddr=North-Head-Scenic-Drive,-Manly,-New-South-Wales\" target=\"_blank\">North-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://maps.google.com.au/maps?daddr=Gap-Bluff-Centre,-Military-Road,-Watsons-Bay,-New-South-Wales\" target=\"_blank\">South-Head</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"publicTransportDirections\"></div>","public_transport":"\n<p>Get public transport information for key locations in Sydney Harbour National Park:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/plan-your-trip/trip-planner?itd_name_destination=Bradley's+Head+Amphitheatre,+Bradleys+Head+Road,+Mosman,+New+South+Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Bradleys-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/plan-your-trip/trip-planner?itd_name_destination=Dobroyd+Scenic+Drive,+Balgowlah+Heights,+New+South+Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Dobroyd-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/plan-your-trip/trip-planner?itd_name_destination=Old+Fort+Road,+Mosman,+New+South+Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Middle-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/plan-your-trip/trip-planner?itd_name_destination=Nielsen+Park,+Greycliffe+Avenue,+Vaucluse,+New+South+Wales\" target=\"_blank\">Nielsen-Park</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/plan-your-trip/trip-planner?itd_name_destination=North+Head+Scenic+Drive,+Manly,+New+South+Wales\" target=\"_blank\">North-Head</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/plan-your-trip/trip-planner?itd_name_destination=Gap+Bluff+Centre,+Military+Road,+Watsons+Bay,+New+South+Wales\" target=\"_blank\">South-Head</a></li>\n</ul>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle Info website</a> for more information about visiting Sydney Harbour National Park by bike.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>Sydney Harbour National Park offers exceptional experiences all year round.

Here are some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Fun for all<br></b>While there are few facilities at Tallaganda, there’s lots of opportunity to get back to nature. Fire trails cross the park and are great for mountain bikers, and some of the walks are for experienced, self-reliant walkers (always take a topographic map with you). Those with a 4WD might like to bump across these trails in their vehicles. There’s also a campground and picnic area at Mulloon Creek that’s accessible by 2WD and is a great spot for overnight camping.</p>\n<p><b>Way to grow<br></b>There’s a diverse range of forest types represented in Tallaganda National Park, including moist forest, dry forest, and smaller amounts of low open forest and subalpine woodlands, particularly in the southern section of the park which features snow gums. This is the best place to go looking for wildflowers during spring, when bluebells and buttercups sprout through the short grass. There’s also some rare high-altitude swampland that’s part of the Montane Peatlands and Swamps Endangered Ecological Community.</p>\n<p><b>Wild inhabitants<br></b>Because there is such a range of environments, many animals call Tallaganda National Park their home. Some, like the echidna, spotted-tail quoll, and red-necked wallaby, are quite numerous. The forest is home to many tree-dwelling animals, including the greater glider, sugar glider, and vulnerable eastern pygmy possum, all of which are more likely to be seen as dusk falls, as are some of the bats that live here.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>A long, rich, Aboriginal heritage</b><br>\nTapin Tops National Park is part of the traditional lands of the Biripi People and this incredible landscape has helped them form their identity and spirituality. The name, ‘Tapin’, means ‘dingo’ in their language, as the park provides habitat to native wild dingos.</p>\n<p><b>Part of our forestry past</b><br>\nPrior to becoming a national park, this area was part of Bulga and Dingo state forests, which were logged over the last 80 years. In the campground, you can see fascinating relics of road building and forestry operations that date back to pioneering days.</p>\n<p><b>A botanist’s dream</b><br>\nAn impressive 20 different forest types have been mapped within the park, providing a fantastic variety of unique plants. The temperate, subtropical rainforest is dominated by corkwood, crabapple, sassafras and booyong with majestic yellow carabeen at higher altitudes. There’s also myrtle-dominated rainforest and viney scrub. This diverse flora habitat has several threatened plants species, such as the endangered climbing vine and a rare, vulnerable orchid. A variety of different eucalypts can be seen in Tapin Tops, including brushbox, tallowwood, blue gum, bloodwood, silvertop stringybark and grey gum.</p>\n<p><b>A birdwatcher’s paradise</b><br>\nBirdwatchers will want to keep their eyes out for the black and gold regent bowerbird, the green catbird, and the topknot pigeons resting in the treetops. Three threatened species of owls have been recorded here (sooty, powerful and masked owls), although if you spot these rare creatures you are lucky indeed, as they are hardly ever seen. During the day, listen out for the superb lyrebird’s call.</p>\n<p><b>So many amazing animals</b><br>\nOther incredible animals you might be lucky enough to encounter here include the parma wallaby, the spotted-tailed quoll, or brushturkeys scratching on the forest floor. Koalas are present feeding at night, moving between trees in search of the succulent leaves from the eucalypt. They then spend most of the day sleeping in the extensive canopy.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001033","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Port Macquarie</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6588 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 22 Blackbutt Road, Port Macquarie 2444</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Tapin Tops National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wherrol Flat (10km)</li>\n<li>Wingham (40km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From: Wingham</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Elands Road and Wherrol Flat Road to Wherrol Flat</li>\n<li>At Wherrol Flat, turn left onto Dingo Tops Road. </li>\n<li>Follow Dingo Tops Road to Tapin Tops National Park</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Tapin Tops National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Living Aboriginal heritage: Kengal<br></b>The dual name of the nature reserve (since 2005) acknowledges a Wiradjuri cultural presence that stretches back many generations. The Rock is also known as Kengal (meaning ‘sloping hill’), a Dreaming place, lookout, and ceremonial site for the Wiradjuri People and their descendants. It was once used for male initiation rituals. Traditional lore has it that Kengal was created by Baiame, the creator who also taught the Wiradjuri People how to make fire and spears. When settlers arrived in the area, stories go, Baiame left his male and female dingo (Mirrigan) companions, who lay in wait for Baiame’s return, forming The Rock.</p>\n<p><b>'The Hanging Rock’</b><br>\nCharles Sturt first saw The Rock in 1829, though the area wasn’t settled further by Europeans until 1874. They called the remarkable geological feature ‘The Hanging Rock’ because of an overhang on its eastern face. This collapsed in 1874, however, leading to the adoption of its current name – simply, ‘The Rock’.

The ancient landscape of the park is part of the cultural knowledge and ‘Dreaming’ stories of the Worimi people and remains an important Aboriginal place today. A walk along the beaches of Tomaree National Park are a walk along ancient travel routes used by Worimi to travel north and south through their Country.</p>\n<p><b>Koala country</b><br>\nTomaree National Park offers the opportunity to see one of Australia’s iconic animals up close. The park is an important release site for rehabilitated sick, injured or orphaned koalas and you’re likely to see them feasting on swamp mahogany in and around the park. A good place to see them is in the trees around One Mile Beach carpark.</p>\n<p><b>Military history</b><br>\nFollow in the footsteps of Australian soldiers on the trail to Tomaree Head. The historic Fort Tomaree played an important role in the defence of Port Stephens during World War II, including Tomaree Head that was solidly armed with gun emplacements. You can take a <a title=\"guided Discovery tour\" href=\"http://www.wildwildworld.com.au/WWW/Search/SearchActivity.aspx?Park=20080416100010065&amp;Region=20101022000000108&amp;StartDate=from&amp;EndDate=to&amp;ShowNonDateEvents=False\" target=\"_blank\">guided Discovery tour</a> of the gun emplacements to find out more about this historic site.</p>\n<p><b>Abundant birdlife</b><br>\nThe park’s beaches and rocks support populations of migratory shore birds including the eastern curlew and red-necked stint. See if you can spot the bar-tailed godwit - this long-beaked bird holds the record for the longest non-stop flight; 11,000km without a break. Visit in winter to see colourful lorikeets and honeyeaters feeding on wildflowers in the coastal heathland and in summer you’ll see migratory tropical species including cuckoos and rainforest pigeons.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001031","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nelson Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4984 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 1, 12B Teramby Road, Nelson Bay NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Tomaree National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shoal Bay (1km)</li>\n<li>Anna Bay (1km)</li>\n<li>Nelson Bay (3km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (50km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (150km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>Tomaree National Park is easily accessible from Nelson Bay and Anna Bay.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Traditional land of the Githabul people<br></b>Tooloom National Park is an Aboriginal place and the traditional land of the Githabul people. For thousands of years, these forests provided shelter, food, medicine and tools. Certain features in and around Tooloom remain deeply significant, such as Bandahngan Aboriginal Area (Tooloom Falls), which is 13km east of the park. The Aboriginal word for ‘Tooloom’ is ‘Dooloomi’, which means ‘head lice’ and relates to the story of these falls.</p>\n<p><b>A good scrub<br></b>The rainforests of Tooloom Scrub are part of Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area, which used to be known as Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves. Tooloom is one of the few areas on Earth in which plants and animals have remained relatively unchanged from their ancestors.</p>\n<p><b>A thriving ecosystem<br></b>Feast your eyes on Tooloom’s magnificent forest communities. Subtropical rainforest, with vines stretching from the soft forest floor to the towering green canopy, are dominated by black booyong. Bird’s nest and staghorn ferns decorate broad trunks, live and dead. Hoop pines break through the canopy of dry rainforest on the upper western slopes. In the wet sclerophyll forests old tallowwood and Sydney blue gums grow. Other forest types include forest red gum, New England blackbutt, grey gum and grey iron bark.  </p>\n<p><b>Full of life<br></b>Although there are as many as 13 species of snake, 10 species of macropod (things that hop) and three other species of mammals in Tooloom, they’ve got nothing on the birds. So far, 214 species of bird have been recorded, including paradise riflebirds, wompoo fuit-doves, regent bowerbirds, yellow-tailed black cockatoos, scarlet honeyeaters, endangered black-breasted button quail, and Coxen’s fig-parrot. Endangered animals inhabiting Tooloom are Fleay’s barred frog, and black-striped wallaby.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001042","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Kyogle</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6632 0000<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:kyogle.area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">kyogle.area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 136 Summerland Way, Kyogle NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Tooloom National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Urbenville (20km)</li>\n<li>Woodenbong (32km)</li>\n<li>Warwick (60km)</li>\n<li>Casino (130km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Woodenbong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From Mount Lindsay Highway, turn towards Urbenville on Urbenville-Koreelah Road.</li>\n<li>Continue for approximately 20km to Tooloom picnic area</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For more information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/plan-your-trip\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a></p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Tooloom National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Living Aboriginal history</b><br>\nImmerse yourself in Toonumbar National Park’s rich Aboriginal history. The park is part of the historic Githabul Nation native title claim. The area is traditional country of the Githabul People and almost wherever you look from the Murray Scrub and Sherwood lookout, these places are of deep, ongoing cultural significance. The forests and landscapes of the park are as physically rich as they are culturally; food, medicine, tools, weapons and shelter were derived from the land for thousands of years.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><b>World Heritage-listed rainforest</b><br>\nThe rainforests of Murray Scrub and Dome Mountain of Toonumbar National Park are part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area. With this incredible abundance of rainforests, your senses certainly won’t be short of things to take in. Keep your camera in hand and explore the vast rainforests along hiking trails. You’ll find white booyong<b>,</b> Bangalow palms, birds nest and staghorn ferns and rare rainforest vines in these forests. There’s also old growth forests of tallowwood and flooded gum.</p>\n<p><b>Wild-a-rama</b><br>\nCamping is a great way to take advantage of one of Toonumbar National Park’s most fantastic assets – its wildlife. The diverse plant life at this park makes it an ideal place for an equally diverse range of animals. You’ll find some super rare species here, such as spot-tailed quoll and red-legged pademelon. Other interesting species you might encounter are yellow-bellied gliders, koalas, small-eyed snakes and carpet pythons.</p>\n<p><b>Nature’s own twitter</b><br>\nAt any time, the peaceful rainforest can erupt in an incredible chorus of song – rare bird species such as sooty owls, white-eared monarchs and the Wompoo fruit-dove, all enjoy tweeting along to their favourite tune. The performance is not only great for birdwatchers to get a closer look at the wonderful birdlife, but also a soothing experience for all nature-lovers. Just don’t forget your binoculars.</p>\n<p><b>Rocks of ages</b><br>\nTwenty-three million years ago, Toonumbar National Park was alive with volcanic activity. Now, the dormant, eroded volcano is the bedrock of a landscape that’s one of the most spectacular parks in New South Wales. The peaks of Dome Mountain (915m), Glassy Mountain (920m) and Edinburgh Castle (893m) are eroded remains from the Focal Peak shield volcano, the same one active 23 million years ago. Incredible views, extraordinary habitats and beautiful rock formations are its legacy.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Show caves","id":"{C58C2DB9-8AC5-475D-84AD-4CB9F6B411DD}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001042","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Kyogle</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6632 0000<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:kyogle.area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">kyogle.area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 136 Summerland Way, Kyogle NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Toonumbar National Park  is close to:</p>\n<br><ul>\n<li>Woodenbong (17km)</li>\n<li>Kyogle (35km)</li>\n<li>Urbenville (45km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Kyogle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leave the Summerland Way and travel west via Kyogle and Murray Scrub Road (approximately 35km)</li>\n<li>To reach the northern end of the park, take Coxs Road, which leaves the Summerland Way about 8km west of Grevillea to join Toonumbar Forest Drive.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>There is no public transport available to Toonumbar National Park.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Toonumbar National Park.

The land and waterways of Torrington, and the plants and animals that live in them, feature in all facets of Aboriginal culture and are associated with dreaming stories told to this day.</p>\n<p><b>Mining heritage<br></b>Go back in time to the by-gone era of mining on the Mole Tableland when hopefuls came from as far as England and China to explore the deposits of tin and other minerals. At its peak in the 1920s, Torrington and nearby villages swelled to accommodate around 600 miners, but sharply declined in 1946 when mining virtually stopped. Try your luck fossicking for semi-precious gemstones like beryl, emerald, topaz and quartz.</p>\n<p><b>Fabulous flowers<br></b>This area is home to over 750 plant species, including 45 rare or threatened species like the rare Beadle’s grevillia and Torrington wattle. In fact, some plant communities thrive in the sedge-heath swamps and mole granite outcrops and can’t be found anywhere else in the world. From September to March the bush is ablaze with colour for the spectacular wildflower display.</p>\n<p><b>Wonderful wildlife<br></b>The unique climatic conditions make Torrington a haven for Australian wildlife. It’s home to 20 mammal, 135 bird, 29 reptile and 13 frog species, including threatened species like the powerful owl and the tiger quoll. You’ll probably see grey kangaroos and wallabies in the distance, and kookaburras and currawongs in the trees overhead. But if you’re lucky, you might also spot rare birds like the striking turquoise parrot and rare regent honeyeater.</p>\n<p><b>Bush experiences<br></b>Take in the dramatic views, magnificent rock formations and stunning wildflowers on the many walking tracks. Set up camp at Blatherarm campground or just spend an afternoon relaxing and picnicking at the various picnic areas. And if you are an experienced bushwalker looking for adventure, why not go exploring by foot into the remote corners in the north.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001254","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tenterfield</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6736 4298<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 10 Miles Street, Tenterfield NSW 2372<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Torrington State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Glen Innes (65km)</li>\n<li>Tenterfield (80km)</li>\n<li>Inverell (136km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Tenterfield:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Head south along the New England Highway for 50km</li>\n<li>Turn right into Stannum Road, just before the town of Deepwater.</li>\n<li>Follow for approximately 30km until you reach the town of Torrington where the conservation area starts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Glen Innes:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Head north along the New England Highway for 40km</li>\n<li>Turn left into Stannum Road, just after the town of Deepwater.</li>\n<li>Follow for approximately 30km until you reach the town of Torrington where the conservation area starts</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>There is no access by public transport to Torrington State Conservation Area.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Torrington State Conservation Area.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>The first people<br></b>The Wonnarua people were the first inhabitants of the Hunter Valley, which was known as Coquun before European settlement. Their name, ‘Wonnarua’, means ‘people of the hills and plains’, and their traditional lands reach from near Maitland in the Upper Hunter to the Great Dividing Range towards Wollombi. Their history in the area is shared with nearby groups such as Worimi to the northeast and Awakakal to the southeast. Towarri means ‘warrior’ in the language of the Wonnarua, and these people fought hard for their land after European settlement.</p>\n<p><b>Snow gums and spinifex<br></b>Three distinct bioregions meet in Towarri: the Sydney Basin, the Brigalow Belt South and North Coast. This means that the soil type, fertility and depth differ throughout the park. Throw in a variation in rainfall, elevation and geological features and the result is a mosaic of plant communities. Snow gums decorate the skyline above a snowgrass understorey on the high plateau areas of Mount Tinagroo and Bald Hill.</p>\n<p><b>Glossy, greater and powerful<br></b>Towarri is inhabited by a range of birds and animals, many with a particularly distinctive call, appearance or ability that appears in their name.

It has provided an abundant source of natural food, being especially rich in seafood and fresh drinking water, for thousands of years. This nature reserve is now a dedicated Aboriginal Place, in recognition of the natural and spiritual significance to this remarkable civilisation. Aboriginal sites, including middens and earth mounds, are all a part of Towra’s fascinating historic landscape.</p>\n<p><b>Captian Cook’s landing<br></b>The site of one of the first contacts between European and Aboriginal peoples, Towra Point is a hugely important place for Australia as we know it today. In April 1770, the Cook expedition explored the area and mapped Towra Lagoon as a source of fresh water. Botany Bay was also the site of some of Australia's first botanical collections by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander; much of what they saw can still be seen here today.<br><br><strong>A birdwatching haven<br></strong>Some of the birds that feed on the intertidal flats around Towra Point migrate over 12,000km, coming from as far away as Siberia, China and Japan. Nearly all the migratory birds here are wading birds or shorebirds. You may spot a royal spoonbill or a Pacific golden plover when you visit the reserve; this is a great place for birdwatching and nature photography. Nearly all of the migratory birds that have used the Towra Point area are wading birds or shorebirds. Approximately 34 of the 80 species of migratory birds listed for protection have been recorded as using the Towra Point wetlands.</p>\n<p><b>Sights to behold<br></b>Boating and kayaking through the maze of waterways is a great way to see Towra Point Nature Reserve. Be sure to stay within sanctuary and refuge zones to help preserve this outstanding environment. Towra Beach picnic area is a popular destination in summer with boaties, who are tempted by the views stretching from Botany Bay to Sans Souci.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001223","contact_details_full":""},{"contact":"20071105000001017","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Kurnell (Kamay Botany Bay National Park)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 9668 2000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Kamay Botany Bay National Park, Cape Solander Drive, Kurnell NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:30 am to 4:30 pm 7 days; closed Christmas Day</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Towra Point NR is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Cronulla (4.2km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (16km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Make your way to Captain Cook Drive, Kurnell.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n\n<p><b>Important cultural history</b><br>\nTuron National Park is Wiradjuri Aboriginal country and is home to many sacred sites that bear witness to the land’s earliest occupiers. Archaeological surveys from recent times have revealed evidence of extensive Aboriginal occupation prior to European arrival in the area. Therefore, the park plays an important role in conserving evidence of traditional, historical and contemporary land use and is of cultural significance to the Wiradjuri people, as well as descendents of early settlers of European and Chinese heritage.</p>\n\n<p><b>A prosperous gold mining area</b><br>\nIn 1851, a delighted Aboriginal prospector found a large gold nugget in the Turon River. Subsequent valuable finds led to the development of the nearby town of Sofala during a gold mining boom.

The ceremonial Bora Ring you’ll see on Walk on Water walking track provides a glimpse into ancient traditions and important Aboriginal ceremonies. Minjungbal Aboriginal Cultural Centre also provides evidence of and information on the rich Aboriginal cultural heritage, both past and living. It’s a popular meeting place for Goori people and the wider Aboriginal community and offers visitors an authentic insight into many aspects of Aboriginal culture.</p>\n<p><b>Packed with plant life</b> <br>\nTweed Heads Historic Site includes a large diversity of coastal vegetation in a relatively small area. Near the cultural centre, you’ll see eucalypt forest and woodlands, but wander along Walk on Water walking track and you’ll see swamp forests with broad-leaved paperbark and swamp she-oaks. On the boardwalk, you’ll see one of the most diverse mangrove communities in NSW. In summer, look out for clusters of small yellow flowers on the grey mangroves. You’ll also see the sea grass beds that make this an important fish breeding habitat and the open grasslands of salt couch between the tide lines.</p>\n<p><b>Animal and birdlife</b> <br>\nTweed Heads Historic Site is a great place to step into a natural world and get up close with the animals. At high tide, you can stand on the boardwalk and watch shoals of fish swimming among the mangroves. You’ll find unique butterflies such as blue triangle, black jezebel and endangered blue mangrove butterfly. For birdwatchers, the forests and waterways provide plenty of birdwatching opportunities. You’ll see shorebirds and waders like the greater egret and royal spoonbill on Walk on Water walking track, particularly at low tide.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><strong>Land of Gumbaynggir<br></strong>As you explore the remote bushland and admire the unspoilt beauty of Ulidarra National Park, you’ll be walking on the traditional lands of the Gumbaynggirr People. The park is part of a larger ‘men’s area’ and was once used for hunting and gathering of bush foods and medicines. The area continues to have special significance for Gumbaynggirr people as it connects them with their Dreamtime stories.</p>\n<p><strong>Park of the people<br></strong>From the early 1880s, Ulidarra National Park and the adjoining Bruxner Park Flora Reserve were used for logging. Throughout the park, you might come across tree stumps that bear the scars of board cuts, a style of tree felling that took place up until the early 1950s. Starting in the early 1930s, local community lobbying for the protection of these areas has seen the protection of Bruxner in 1933, the establishment of Bruxner Park Flora Reserve in 1958, and later the establishment of Ulidarra and nearby Bindarri National Park in 1999.</p>\n<p><strong>Mid North Coast menagerie<br></strong>Along with the adjoining Bruxner Park Flora Reserve, Ulidarra provides important habitats for a diverse range of wildlife, including koalas, masked owls, dingoes and little bent-wing bats.  Some 232 native vertebrate species make this beautiful place their home, including 40 different mammals, reptiles, frogs and fish. If you’re lucky, you might spot threatened species such as Stephens’ banded snakes, yellow-bellied gliders and powerful owls.</p>\n<p><strong>Birdwatching at its best<br></strong>There are 125 different bird species found in Ulidarra, making it a haven for birdwatching. Amongst the myriad of birds you’ll find here, you might catch a glimpse of threatened species such as glossy black-cockatoos, brown tree-creepers, barred cuckoo-shrikes, black bitterns, barking owls, powerful owls, wompoo fruit-doves and rose-crowned fruit-doves.</p>\n<p><strong>Precious plant life<br></strong>Ulidarra National Park provides an important link between the hinterland and plateau habitats of the World Heritage-listed <a title=\"Dorrigo National Park\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/dorrigo-national-park\" target=\"_self\">Dorrigo National Park</a>, connecting the mountain ranges of Tuckers Nob in <a title=\"Bindarri National Park\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/bindarri-national-park\" target=\"_self\">Bindarri National Park</a> to the coastal habitats of <a title=\"Moonee Beach Nature Reserve\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/moonee-beach-nature-reserve\" target=\"_self\">Moonee Beach Nature Reserve</a> and <a title=\"Coffs Coast Regional Park\" href=\"http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/coffs-coast-regional-park\" target=\"_self\">Coffs Coast Regional Park</a>.  The park conserves rare lowland rainforest, with species such as red carabeen, booyong and bangalow palms.  You'll also find old growth sclerophyll forest with coastal blackbutt and turpentine trees, and small areas of wet sclerophyll forest dominated by brushbox.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001039","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coffs Harbour</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6652 0900<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 32 Marina Drive, Coffs Harbour NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Ulidarra National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (7km)</li>\n<li>Woolgoolga (25km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (77km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Coffs Harbour:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north on Pacific Highway for approximately 5km</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Bruxner Park Road and continue winding your way up the escarpment past the banana farms</li>\n<li>At the Sealy lookout turn-off, continue west for approximately 1.8km and turn left into Orara East State Forest.</li>\n<li>Travel along the gravel road for approximately 1.3km until you reach the Ulidarra National Park sign</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Ulidarra National Park is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the Bicycle information for NSW website for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Ulidarra National Park.

They are the surviving stands of what was once the largest area of sub-tropical rainforest in Australia, with over 150 species of trees including white booyong, red bean, Morton Bay fig and the extremely rare jointed baloghia. In 1975, plans to double the size of the reserve began, and now you’ll be able to see regenerated rainforest as well as some of the original giants that were saved from the axe.</p>\n<p><b>Young and old<br></b>Victoria Park Nature Reserve provides a quality nature experience for everyone, catering for all ages. The boardwalk, designed for prams and wheelchairs, meanders through lush tropical rainforest. With a communal galley, shaded picnic tables and accessible facilities, anyone can relax and enjoy a picnic or barbecue.</p>\n<p><b>Rainforest dwellers<br></b>The diverse sub-tropical rainforest found in the reserve is host to a range of wildlife, such as red-legged pademelons, bandicoots, green catbirds and crested hawks. While some of the forest residents are quite shy, the curious eastern yellow robin flitters from tree to tree and takes an active interest in visitors. Look for broken empty shells scattered near a flat rock and the noisy pitta won’t be too far away.</p>\n<p><b>Ancient wisdom<br></b>Learn about the unique relationship the local Aboriginal people have with the Big Scrub. On a series of informative displays along the boardwalk, discover how the Widjabul people of the Bundjalung nation used rainforest plants for food and medicine.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b> <br>\nThe Yuin people consider Wadbilliga National Park a sacred place and many sites in the park are strongly associated with Dreamtime stories. The dissected, rugged escarpment contains a network of bridle tracks that follow both high country and river courses, which Aboriginal people originally used. The bridle tracks are also the most tangible historical link with the first Europeans in the area and were used for transporting produce and moving stock from one location to another. The park is abundant in traditional foods and medicines.</p>\n<p><b>A glimpse of gold mining history<br></b>The surrounding area has a variety of artefacts, structures and features that hark back to gold and silver mining eras, as well as the early forestry history of the local area. Today, visitors can still view various mining remains that are evidence of once arduous searches for gold and other precious materials.</p>\n<p><b>A botanist’s wonderland<br></b>Wadbilliga has many impressive examples of open forest, woodland, heath, swamp, bogs and numerous pockets of rainforest. There are some rare species of eucalypt and acacia that do not occur anywhere else. In the Wadbilliga Valley, yellow box and forest red gum can be seen, while on the ridge tops tower large stands of silvertop ash with snow gums at high altitudes. The Wadbilliga Plateau also has dwarf she-oaks and rare stunted mallee eucalypts.</p>\n<p><b>A natural animal sanctuary<br></b>Due to the rugged and isolated nature of the park, animal populations here have remained relatively undisturbed. Many of the park's animals are large marsupials such as swamp wallabies, eastern grey kangaroos and wombats. There are also possums, platypuses and echidnas and one of the biggest greater glider populations in all of Australia. The birdlife is varied too, with over 120 native species. Lyrebirds are common as are many colourful and tuneful bush birds.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001023","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Narooma</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4476 0800<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Cnr Graham & Burrawang Sts, Narooma NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001022","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bombala</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6458 4080<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 153 Maybe Street, Bombala NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-12:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Nimmitabel (30km)</li>\n<li>Cooma  (40km)</li>\n<li>Canberra (150 km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (400km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<ul>\n<li>Conventional cars can reach Wadbilliga Crossing picnic area from the east via Bourkes Road.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><strong>Aboriginal heritage</strong><br>\nBahtabah Local Aboriginal Land Council represents the Aboriginal community in the area that is now covered by Wallarah National Park. Physical evidence of Aboriginal people’s lives in the area has remained in the form of middens found just south of Swansea. Only a few middens have been recorded, though it is probable that sand mining along this coast over the years has destroyed a large portion of middens that were there prior to European settlement.</p>\n<p><strong>Wild and free</strong><br>\nWallarah has an awesome collection of birds and animals due to the diversity of vegetation and habitats in the park. During the day, look out for sea eagles soaring along the coast, honeyeaters in the springtime flowering heath, lizards lolling on warm boulders, pods of dolphins in the ocean and passing whales during the winter months. At night, you may see the predatory powerful owl, a microbat, or the threatened squirrel glider that glides for up to 50m between trees. Bring along your binoculars to get a closer look at these natural beauties.</p>\n<p><strong>Happy wandering</strong><br>\nThere are various vegetation communities in Wallarah, including heathland, spotted gum and ironbark forest, open smooth-barked apple forest and palm gully rainforest with a canopy dominated by cabbage-tree palm. Follow the various walking tracks through the park to experience these. Keep an eye out for blooming wattle and the intriguing scribbly gum, whose attractive artwork is, in fact, the tunnelling journey of scribbly gum moth’s larvae. By the way, the purple-flowered vine you’ll see growing throughout the park is known commonly as happy wanderer.</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t just stand there</strong><br>\nDo you like to surf, or are you more into fishing? Are you the type who loves to hike, or do you prefer cycling? Are you an ocean-gazer or a forest-walker? Wallarah allows you to do any or all of these activities, so bring your gear and enjoy this natural playground.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001016","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Lake Munmorah</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4972 9000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Blue Wren Drive, Munmorah State Conservation Area<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Wallarah National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swansea (2km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (30km)</li>\n<li>Gosford (60km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (120km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Swansea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the Pacific Highway, turn left onto Bowman Street.</li>\n<li>Continue along into Park Avenue and turn right onto Caves Beach Road</li>\n<li>Continue until you reach the locked gate at the end of Spoon Rocks Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Gosford or Newcastle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the F3 to the Motorway Link (exit to Swansea), then continue along the Pacific Highway towards Swansea.</li>\n<li>From the Pacific Highway, turn right into Bowman Street at the roundabout.</li>\n<li>Continue along into Park Avenue, then turn right onto Caves Beach Road.</li>\n<li>Continue until you reach the locked gate at the end of Spoon Rocks Road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW transport info website\" href=\"http://www.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Wallarah National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ancient footprints</b><br>\nThe 6,557ha of Wallingat National Park is part of the identity and spirituality, as well as a resource, for people of the Worimi nation. A central campsite was known to exist in the area now known as Coomba Park, although there are few recorded Aboriginal sites within the park. Worimi people used the leaves of the cabbage palm for weaving baskets and its fibrous bark for making fishing line.</p>\n<p><b>Flying frenzy</b><br>\nMore than 200 species of birds make their home at Wallingat, and walking through the forest, you’ll hear them singing. Noisy friarbirds, for instance, have a distinctive ‘ya-kob’ call, while a ‘woop woop woop’ sound signals the presence of the wonga pigeon. You might see blue wrens flitting through the trees, as well as king parrots and glossy black cockatoos. This is also a popular spot for the satin bowerbird – the males are black and shiny, the females are a plainer brown. They both, however, have startling lilac eyes.</p>\n<p><b>Tall timber</b><br>\nSurrounding some of the picnic areas and campsites, you’ll find magnificent stands of trees. In the southeast corner of Wallingat, there are tall, straight flooded gums, as well as stands of cabbage palms. Find both during a walk from Sugar Creek picnic area. Some rare plants such as the liana woody climber, a climbing species that bears white flowers from August to May, can also be found here.</p>\n<p><b>Fun times</b><br>\nWhether you’re after a relaxing time or something more adventurous, Wallingat is just the spot. Take to the gravel roads – either on foot, in a car or on a bike – to explore the forests. You can swim, fish and paddle on Wallingat River. Pitch a tent in the campground and get away from it all for a few days in this naturally beautiful setting.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001030","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Great Lakes (Pacific Palms)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6591 0300<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> \"The Ruins\" Camping Ground, Booti Booti National Park, The Lakes Way, Pacific Palms NSW 2428<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday (closed public holidays)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001031","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nelson Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4984 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 1, 12B Teramby Road, Nelson Bay NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Wallingat National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pacific Palms (22km)</li>\n<li>Forster (40km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Forster:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel 30km south along Lakes Way to Sugar Creek Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Bulahdelah:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head north on Pacific Highway</li>\n<li>Turn right at Lakes Way – it is signposted Forster</li>\n<li>Follow Lakes Way for approximately 40km to Sugar Creek Road (2.5kms past Bungwahl)</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Wallingat National Park.

The landscape, plants and animals of the park are a constant reminder of its sacred significance to Aboriginal people today. Take an Aboriginal Discovery guided tour to find out more about the Aboriginal cultural heritage.</p>\n<p><b>Landscape and geology</b><br>\nThe landscape of Warrumbungle National Park has been shaped by thousands of years of volcanic activity; spend some time looking at Crater Bluff and Belougery Spire and imagine the vents of magma that once erupted to create these formations. Old lava flows created at Mount Exmouth and Siding Spring Mountain, just outside the boundary of the park and Belougery Split Rock and Bluff Mountain are great examples of volcanic action. The most iconic feature in the park, The Breadknife, is a volcanic dyke which stands a massive 90m tall.</p>\n<p><b>Wish upon a star</b><br>\nNearby Coonabarabran is known as the ‘<a title=\"Astronomy Capital of Australia\" href=\"http://www.coonabarabran.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Astronomy Capital of Australia</a>’ and Warrumbungle National Park is the ultimate place to see infinite stars. Admire the view from your campsite, or if you want to see right up to the heavens, visit the Siding Springs Observatory, or take your own telescope for a spectacular view of the Milky Way.</p>\n<p><b>Capture a classic photo</b><br>\nThe park’s big sky, amazing light and dramatic yet fragile rock formations make Warrumbungle National Park an outstanding place for amateur and professional photographers alike. The dramatic mix of volcanic spires and domes, plateaus, forested ridges and tall volcanic dykes are bound to make even the youngest of photographers look good, so whatever you do - don't forget your camera.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Visitor centres","id":"{5ECE713D-CBE7-4594-9312-1D9D05B8B1BA}"},{"name":"Show caves","id":"{C58C2DB9-8AC5-475D-84AD-4CB9F6B411DD}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001067","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Coonabarabran (Warrumbungle National Park)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6825 4364<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Off John Renshway Parkway, Warrumbungle National Park<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Warrumbungle National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coonabarabran (35km)</li>\n<li>Coonamble (100km)</li>\n<li>Gilgandra (80km)</li>\n<li>Gulargambone (55km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Coonabarabran, take John Renshaw Parkway.</p>\n<p>From Gilgandra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Newell Highway north towards Coonabarabran</li>\n<li>Turn left off the highway into the village of Tooraweenah</li>\n<li>Follow the brown Tourist Drive 1 north through Tooraweenah</li>\n<li>Continue for 26km to the T-intersection at Gummin Gummin homestead</li>\n<li>Turn right onto John Renshaw Parkway and continue for 8km</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Coonamble, take Castlereagh Highway and turn left into King Street.

Stretch your legs on an expansive network of graded walking tracks, including the popular World Heritage walk (which links Gibraltar Range and Washpool National Parks) and part of the Bicentennial National trail. Nature strolls and the half-day Washpool walk commence from the creekside Coombadjha campground and take you on a meander through the lost world of the surrounding rainforest.</p>\n<p><b>Rare residents</b><br>\nA huge range of threatened and endangered species enjoy the sanctuary of Washpool’s diverse habitats. It’s a refuge for mammals including koalas, spotted-tailed quolls, parma wallabies and long-nosed potoroos. Washpool and Gibraltar Range National Park are also brimming with birdlife. Look out for the rare rufous scrub bird in the rainforest undergrowth and, if you’re extra vigilant, the even rarer powerful owl, which inhabits the hollows of trees in tall open forest. One of the most intriguing of the Washpool's residents is the pouched frog, a rainforest-dependent species whose male rears young tadpoles in pouches on his flanks.</p>\n<p><b>An important legacy</b><br>\nWashpool National Park is part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area, which includes forty parks and reserves stretching along the Great Escarpment from Barrington Tops in NSW to south east Queensland. The area has a long history of selective logging, dating back to the 1800s when the valuable red cedar trees drew timber cutters with bullocks, axes and crosscut saws. With the development of machinery, the increasing pressure to exploit these forests met strong protest action from conservation groups. Ultimately, the park was created in 1983 after a study found the area contained significant plant and animal populations that either weren't found anywhere else in the state or were not well protected in reserves.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001036","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Glen Innes</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6739 0700<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 68 Church Street, Glen Innes NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Washpool National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glen Innes (74km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (89km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Glen Innes, head east for around 78km and take the Coachwood Drive turnoff from the Gwydir Highway</p>\n<p>From Grafton, head west for around 93km and take the Coachwood Drive turnoff from the Gwydir Highway</p>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>Washpool National Park offers an exceptional visit all year round.

Given that there are only six known Aboriginal engraving sites in the wider Sydney region, this one is particularly noteworthy for its display of more than 100 abstract motifs carved into walls throughout the park.</p>\n<p><strong>Building a nation<br></strong>Log chutes and old saw mill sites used during past forestry operations still stand among the plants as a testament to the region’s rich settlement history. By the 1820s, a fertile timber industry had established itself, providing cedar and hardwood from the area to the building and growing coal mining industries. Increased timber production provided employment and wealth to the region, and you can still see relics from these operations throughout the park.</p>\n<p><b>Blossoming rainforest<br></b>The area is rich in plant life, producing moist forests and a wealth of plant species. Mountain blue gums and blackbutt trees shelter the smaller brush cherry, climbing vines and tree ferns. Across late winter and into early spring, colourful orange-coloured banksias, brilliant purple happy wanderers, and the many hues of yellow wattle trees all flower in bright abundance.</p>\n<p><strong>Breathtaking views<br></strong>From Monkey Face lookout, there are spectacular views down over Martinsville Valley, and 6km along Georges Road to the north, Narrow Place lookout provides a 180-degree panorama toward Cessnock, Hunter Valley and beyond the Barrington Ranges. There are so many ways to enjoy the scenery, whether by horse riding, 4WD touring in the wetter months, mountain bike riding or pulling into a shaded picnic area to cool down after a walk.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001016","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Lake Munmorah</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4972 9000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Blue Wren Drive, Munmorah State Conservation Area<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:00pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Watagans National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Cessnock (30 km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (40 km)</li>\n<li>Gosford (60 km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Newcastle:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Travel south along the F3 Expressway and take the Awaba exit at Ryhope</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Cessnock Road and then left onto Freemans Drive at Freemans Waterhole</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Mount Faulk Road from Freemans Drive just after crossing over the F3 expressway for the second time</li>\n<li>Follow Mount Faulk Road uphill into the park</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Gosford:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Travel north along the F3 Expressway and take the Morriset/Coorangbong exit near Freemans Waterhole</li>\n<li>Turn left into Freemans Drive, and travel south to Martinsville Road on the left.</li>\n<li>Follow Martinville Road to Watagan Road on the left and follow uphill to Watagan Forest Road</li>\n<li>Turn right and follow approximately 6km to the park</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Cessnock:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Travel from Cessnock to Kitchener and Quorrobolong via Quorrobolong Road</li>\n<li>Turn left into Sandy Creek Road and travel east for 5km</li>\n<li>Turn right into Heaton Road then onto Watagan Road (unsealed) which will bring you to the northern end of the Watagans</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>There is no public transport to Watagans National Park.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Watagans National Park.</p>\n<p>Spring (Sept, Oct, Nov)</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Camp at Gap Creek or Bangalow campground and enjoy a campfire as the sun sets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summer (Dec, Jan, Feb)</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Cooling off at Boarding House Dam is especially popular during summer months</li>\n<li>Enjoy the moist and cool Circuit walking track</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winter (Jun, Jul, Aug)</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Late winter sees the bloom of Illawara flame trees which can be seen across the valley from Gap Creek lookout</li>\n<li>Check out the views from the various lookouts, while the air is crisp and clean.</li>\n</ul>\n","temperature":"\n<p>Summer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 16°C and 30°C</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded temperature in summer is 44°C</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winter ­</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 5°C and 16°C</li>\n<li>The area’s lowest recorded temperature in winter is -6.7°C</li>\n</ul>\n","rainfall":"\n<ul>\n<li>The wettest month on average is December, the driest is July.</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded rainfall is 91.4mm in one day</li>\n</ul>"},"spatial_data":[{"type":"Marker","gid_id":"{08CDEACF-E72F-4BEC-9064-18526A2AF06B}","spatial_data":"POINT (151.373809 -33.008364999999984)"}],"alerts":[{"title":"Watagans National Park","description":"\n<strong class=\"fires\">FIRES</strong>\n<br />\nThere is a major fire in this park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Rock stars</b><br>\nThe Weddin Mountains are a large, crescent-shaped range that rises sharply from the surrounding plains. This prominent feature can be seen from up to 50km away. There are a number of interesting rock formations, cliff lines and small caves, particularly on the northern and eastern side of the mountain. Deep gullies between gentler slopes produce some lovely small waterfalls after a good rain.</p>\n<p><b>Any way you like it<br></b>The park offers both relaxing and adventurous recreational opportunities. Picnickers can enjoy a campfire and barbecue at Ben Hall’s campground, while more adventurous visitors can walk the mountain range on a variety of walking tracks.</p>\n<p><b>Where there’s a will<br></b>In 1936, the Seaton family began developing property on the western side of the Weddin Mountains as a pastoral enterprise. Money and resources were scarce during the Great Depression, so the farm was built using second-hand materials fashioned into solid structures. Seaton’s Farm is a testimony to the ingenuity used by the Seatons when times were tough. It provides brilliant insight into how this farming family lived during the mid-1900s. The Weddin Mountains are also well-known as the hideout of bushrangers Ben Hall and John Bow, infamously involved in the Escort Robbery at Eugowra.</p>\n<p><b>Protected population<br></b>The Weddin Mountains harbour 12 threatened plant species and 39 threatened bird species. In spring, many lilies and orchids come into bloom, as do winged peppercress and slender darling pea. The diversity in vegetation from the base of the mountain to the top also accommodates a variety of bird species, from larger emus to smaller robins and thornbills.

Lower Hunter spotted gums and ironbark form part of the park’s thick bushland, and are a rich source of food for the winter birds that flock here. Check out Kurri sand swamp woodland and Hunter lowlands red gum forest as they are home to endangered ecological communities. Spring wildflowers such as purple happy wanderer, yellow hairpin banksia and red mountain devil all bloom here. There are also delicate ground orchids and lovely purple thyme honey myrtle sprinkled throughout the park.</p>\n<br><p><b>Abundant animals</b><br>\nMore than 200 native species have been recorded in the park and surrounds. You’ll likely see tree-dwellers like gliders, possums and bats at night. Old favourites like wallabies can also be seen feasting on the luscious landscape. Lizards, like the common scaly-foot and Burton's snake lizard, might be a little harder to find, but keep looking.</p>\n<p><b>Birds galore</b><br>\nIf you like birds, you’ll love Werakata. The abundance of ironbark and spotted gum, which flower in winter, attracts the threatened swift parrot and regent honeyeater. The trees’ blooms are an important winter food source for the birds and.the park becomes a winter breeding ground.But there is a lot of birdlife all year round. Powerful owls, masked owls, various robins, and lorikeets can all be seen here, so be sure to bring your binoculars for some great birdwatching.</p>\n<p><b>Conservation at its core</b><br>\nConservation is a vital aspect of this national park. Over 400 species of plants are known to exist here, and the preservation of the land means animals, including dwarf green tree frogs and peron’s tree frogs among others, can thrive and be seen here all year round.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001014","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Central Coast</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4320 4200 (general enquiries), 02 4320 4203 (camping enquiries)<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:central.coast@environment.nsw.gov.au\">central.coast@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Suites 36-38, 207 Albany Street North, Gosford NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30 am-4:30 pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001015","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bulga</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6574 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 2156 Putty Road, Bulga NSW 2330<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:30am-4:00pm, Tuesday-Thursday only</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Werakata National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abermain (6km)</li>\n<li>Cessnock (9km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (60km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (160km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a> </p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Werakata National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>4,000 years of Aboriginal cultural heritage<br></b>The conservation area is located within the traditional lands of the Widjabal clan of the Bundjalung Nation. Evidence from recorded sites suggests Aboriginal use of the Nightcap Range for at least the last 4,000 years. The area has intrinsic cultural values to the Widjabal People and the land has significant connections with other recorded sites in the adjacent Nightcap National Park.</p>\n<p><b>Historic heritage of timber-getters<br></b>Lured by the opportunity of employment in difficult times, timber-getters began logging in the Whian Whian area in the 1830s for red cedar, a particularly sought after timber. In 1871, surveyors identified a track over Nightcap Range to link Lismore with Murwillumbah. This allowed cedar-getters access to previously isolated expanses of forest. The Rummery Park campground was originally a forestry camp, and its use dates back to the 1930s. The inter-war period was the most active period for forestry use of the campground. Peates Mountain Road (now part of the Nightcap track) was built during the depression of the 1920s and 1930s. Sleeper-cutters who claimed timber unsuitable for milling, camped nearby on the other side of Boggy Creek at Rummery Park.</p>\n<p><b>World heritage worthy<br></b>The conservation area has similar vegetation and natural heritage values as those found in the adjoining Nightcap National Park, one of the 50 reserves in northeast NSW and southeast Queensland that make up World Heritage Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves Australia.</p>\n<p><b>Plant life galore<br></b>An astounding 520 plant species have been recorded here – making it an incredibly diverse place when it comes to vegetation. There are 10 broad ecosystems, including subtropical and warm temperate rainforests and various types of wet sclerophyll forest.</p>\n<p><b>Walk with the animals<br></b>There’s also an incredible variety of native animal species thriving in these rainforests – over 270 native species, around 50 of which are listed as threatened, including the spotted tailed quoll. Koalas and Albert’s lyrebird, with its distinctive calls and mimicking echoes, can often be heard through the forest in the cooler months.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001041","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Lismore/Alstonville</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6627 0200<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:northernrivers.region@environment.nsw.gov.au\">northernrivers.region@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Colonial Arcade, 75 Main Street, Alstonville NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Whian Whian State Conservation Area is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Brisbane (20km)</li>\n<li>Lismore (25km)</li>\n<li>Bangalow (31km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From the north (Brisbane):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travelling on the Pacific Highway exit south of Byron Bay, at the top of the hill, turn right into Coolamon Scenic Drive.

The wetlands, woodlands and grassy plains of the park house 23 species of reptile and over 195 different types of bird including emu and the endangered plains-wanderer.\nSee kangaroos graze and play on the plains at dusk and dawn, look out for bearded dragons as you cycle the Merton trail, and spot a harmless carpet snake near the...

Take a look at (but please don't touch) the remains of oven hearths, broken pieces of grinding dishes and stone flakes. Nilla Yannagalang Billana, the only formal walking track in the park, means “walking along together” in Wiradjuri.</p>\n<p><strong>The ringer looks around</strong><br>\nBig Willandra Station once stretched from Hillston to Mossgiel and covered an area eight times that of what is now Willandra National Park. Some buildings from the huge merino stud are in ruins, while others have been restored. In its time, Big Willandra saw it all: illegal squatting, leasehold, freehold, homesteading, the establishment of the Western Lands Commission, resumptions and soldier settler occupation. Today, you can enjoy cheap heritage accommodation, ideal for a weekend family or group getaway.</p>\n<p><strong>What bird is that?</strong><br>\nCould there really be 195 species of birdlife within an area of less than 20,000ha? The diversity of Willandra’s natural environment – from woodland and wetland to grassland and open plain – provides a variety of habitats. The result is an eclectic mix that includes emu, swan, seagull, night heron, raptor and duck. Set yourself the challenge to see how many different birds you can spot during your visit.</p>\n<p><strong>Plain to see</strong><br>\nWindmill, cane, spear and white top – the names of Australian native grasses really have evolved to become far more fun than their original Latin terms. These grasses now make up most of the ground cover on the park’s plains. Saltbush and cottonbush dominated - and still does - but Europeans quickly recognised the nutritional value of these plants and a century of grazing has changed the environment. A hike through the wetlands, woodlands and grasslands of the park, rich with birds and animals, is a reminder of how nature continues to adapt.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001268","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Griffith</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6966 8100 <br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 200 Yambil Street, Griffith NSW 2680<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Willandra National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mossgiel (61km)</li>\n<li>Hillston (73km)</li>\n<li>Griffith (181km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Hillston:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive northwest out of Hillston, staying on Kidman Way, then join Lachlan River Road at the roundabout.</li>\n<li>Turn left onto Roto Road then left onto Mossgiel Trunk Road and follow for 53km</li>\n<li>At the Trida-Whealbah intersection, turn north and drive 20km to park entrance.</li>\n<li>The campground and homestead are another 10.3km east along Willandra National Park Road</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>. </p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Willandra National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>An ancient story<br></b>Today’s lush rainforests are direct relations of the ancient forests of Gondwana within the Antarctic Circle. Around 80 million years ago, the ancestral continent broke up and Australia started moving north, which eventually reduced most of the rainforests to a narrow strip along south-eastern Australia. As well as World Heritage-listed rainforests, the park protects a diversity of vegetation, including old growth eucalypt forests and open heath. This diverse vegetation provides food and shelter for a medley of creatures; small ground mammals and bats, the endangered Hastings River mouse, the yellow-bellied glider. Australia’s largest marsupial carnivore, the spotted-tailed quoll, also calls Willi Willi home.</p>\n<p><b>The land provides balance<br></b>The name Willi Willi National Park is derived from the local Dunghutti Aboriginal word 'willai' meaning possum. The repetition of the word indicates a plural form translating roughly as “many possums”. Dunghutti Aboriginal Nguloongooras (wise elders) would perform secret ‘increase rituals’ on sacred mountain tops such as Kemps Pinnacle, near the western boundary of the park, to extend their food supply. Placing limits on certain species during seasonal variations allowed for a natural increase in food resources. It was the wish of their great deity, Woormprahl, for them to create this balance with nature.</p>\n<p><b>Ground beneath our feet<br></b>The geology of Willi Willi National Park is for the most part mudstone, sandstone and conglomerate, making the terrain exceptionally steep and rugged.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Biripi country</b><br>\nWingham Brush is part of the traditional lands of the Biripi people. Prior to European occupation, the Biripi people used the area to collect bush tucker, medicinal plants, and for social gatherings by the river. ‘Wingan’ in the local Aboriginal language means ‘where bats come to drink’. Sit by the banks of the river and you might see bats and flying foxes diving into the river to quench their thirst.</p>\n<p><b>The Wingham Brush method</b><br>\nWingham Brush was once pristine rainforest but under European settlement, the area was selectively logged, especially for red cedar. You can still see the remains of two saw pits today from the mid-1800s. Fortunately, in 1909, it became a reserve, with the historic wharf on Manning River. But by 1980, the rainforest was infested with weeds, which threatened its very survival. Thanks to the dedication of the Wingham Brush regeneration team, and what is now internationally recognised as ‘The Wingham Brush method’, the rainforest has since been regenerated and returned to its natural state.</p>\n<p><b>Unique rainforest<br></b>Wingham Brush is an endangered rainforest community and one of the few remnants of subtropical lowland rainforest in Manning Valley. It has at least 195 species of native plants, including 76 species of trees and 32 different vines. Wander along the boardwalk and you’ll see impressive trees like the gigantic Moreton Bay figs, giant stinging tree and shiny-leaved stinging. Keep a lookout for the largest known blush walnut tree in Australia, with a height of 37m and a diameter of over 1m.</p>\n<p><b>Friendly flying foxes<br></b>Wingham Brush is the only known continuously occupied roosting and maternity site for the vulnerable grey-headed flying fox between Bellingen and the Hunter Valley, peaking at over 200,000 flying foxes in the warmer months. They roost by day and fly out at night to feed. Guided in the dark by excellent eyesight and sense of smell, they forage for up to 40km from their roost. Sit by the banks of the river at sunset and you’ll see this spectacular sight as they fly out in search of food. Fans of other flying things will love birdwatching here too You’ll find over 100 bird species here, including the osprey, black-necked stork or jabiru and wompoo fruit-dove.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001034","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Taree</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6552 4097<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 78 Hargreaves Street, Taree NSW 2430<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Wingham Brush Nature Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wingham (0km)</li>\n<li>Taree (12km)</li>\n<li>Forster (46km)</li>\n<li>Port Macquarie (97km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Taree:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow Wingham Road north-west to the township of Wingham</li>\n<li>As you enter the township, turn left into Isabella Street.</li>\n<li>Continue until you see the entrance and carpark next to Wingham School</li>\n<li>Alternatively, continue past Isabella Street, turn left into Farquhar Street, and follow to the end where you’ll see another entrance and carpark.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Wingham Brush Nature Reserve is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.  Please note bikes are not permitted within the reserve.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Wingham Brush Nature Reserve Here are some of the highlights:</p>\n<p>Spring (Sept, Oct, Nov)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wander through the rainforest by day, then, on the banks of the river at sunset, watch the spectacular sight of flying foxes flying out in search of food.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summer (Dec, Jan, Feb)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Escape the holiday crowds, enjoy cooler temperatures under the rainforest canopy and see grey-headed flying foxes when breeding reaches its peak.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Autumn (Mar, Apr, May)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy the peaceful ambience and see the beautiful autumn colours on the leaves of the white cedars as you wander along the boardwalk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winter (Jun, Jul, Aug)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your eyes out for seasonal altitudinal migrants, such as fruit pigeons, bowerbirds and bats foraging in the rainforest.</li>\n</ul>\n","temperature":"\n<p>Summer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 16°C and 29°C</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded temperature in summer is 45.2°C</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Winter ­</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The average temperature ranges between 6°C and 20°C</li>\n<li>The area’s lowest recorded temperature in winter is -5°C</li>\n</ul>\n","rainfall":"\n<ul>\n<li>The wettest month on average is March, the driest is September.</li>\n<li>The area's highest recorded rainfall is 789.7mm in one day</li>\n</ul>"},"spatial_data":[{"type":"Marker","gid_id":"{627AFB13-48F2-4742-8CB6-4E131552CA7F}","spatial_data":"POINT (152.38037900000003 -31.870160999999982)"}],"alerts":[{"title":"Wingham Brush Nature Reserve","description":"\n<strong class=\"closed-areas\">CLOSED AREAS</strong>\n<br/>\nTEST entire park closure all parks in state, now, all PWG regions selected.<br />\n(Ends  Thursday 5 December)<br />\n<strong class=\"fire-ban\">FIRE BAN</strong>\n<br />\nA <a href=\"http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/fire/totalfirebans.htm\">park fire ban</a> applies in the park.\n<br />\n"}]},{"ParkURL":"http://nationalparks2.aws.rroom.net/woko-national-park","contact_details":{"website":"http://nationalparks2.aws.rroom.net/woko-national-park","phone":null,"email":null},"name":"woko-national-park","ItemID":"{1F92E6C7-17BA-4268-BD5D-6C5F868E3DC6}","seo":{"meta_title":"Woko National Park","meta_description":"Woko National Park is a steep, rugged landscape with important reserves of NSW forest land, perfect for exploring on a school excursion, and great for swimming, walking, river camping and free barbecues.","keywords":null,"activites_interest_keywords":"Accommodation Gloucester, caravan sites, river camping, barbecues, swimming, day walk, walking with children, road trip","location_keywords":"Gloucester"},"visual_tour":{"image":[{"title":"","description":"Cliff Face track provides a challenging walk through the best of Woko National Park, with dramatic scenic views towards the escarpment above.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Aboriginal cultural heritage</b><br>\nThe Biripi people of the Manning Valley were the first to inhabit this area, with several open campsites having been recorded along the ridgelines and peaks of the park. Indeed, ‘Woko’ is thought to be a local Aboriginal name for the boobook owl. Aboriginal culture engages with the land, waterways, plants and animals of a specific place; the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with local Aboriginal communities to protect this heritage for future generations.</p>\n<p><b>Rare animals</b><br>\nWoko National Park contains a number of threatened or endangered species, including the brush-tailed rock wallaby, masked owl, and wompoo pigeon. This is, in fact, prime territory for birdwatching, with lyrebirds, brush turkeys, and wedge-tailed eagles regularly spotted in the park. Largely, this is due to the variety of environments encompassed by Woko: the grey fantail, for example, favours the mid-layer of the forest, while the willy wagtail enjoys the openness of the forest edge and spaces created by cattle clearing.</p>\n<p><b>Significant forest</b><br>\nWoko conserves 8598ha of regionally significant forest communities, including part of one of the most extensive areas of dry rainforest in NSW. The steep hills in the park are occupied by a variety of plants and forest types, from dry sclerophyll forest to subtropical rainforest and eucalypt zones. This makes a walk here particularly fascinating, as you traverse different regions and watch the landscape transform before your very eyes.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001029","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Gloucester</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6538 5300<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 59 Church Street, Gloucester NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001031","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Nelson Bay</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4984 8200<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Level 1, 12B Teramby Road, Nelson Bay NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Woko National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gloucester (40km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (350km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Gloucester:</p>\n<br><ul>\n<li>Drive 14km north along Thunderbolts Way</li>\n<li>Turn onto Curricabark Road, then drive another 14km.</li>\n<li>Take Flood Detour Road into Woko National Park (about 1km), then turn left into Woko campground.</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Woko National Park.

Party sizes in wilderness areas are restricted to a maximum of eight people. The <a href=\"/parksafety/WalkingSafety.htm\">bushwalking safety</a> pages provide helpful information. If you are venturing into areas of the parks that have canyons, you can find out more about <a href=\"/parksafety/Canyoning.htm\">canyoning</a> care and safety.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ancient connections</b><br>\nThe area that is now Wollemi National Park has held significance to Aboriginal people for at least 12,000 years. Evidence of this connection can be seen throughout the park, including ceremonial grounds, stone arrangements, grinding grooves, scarred trees and rock engravings. There are around 120 known Aboriginal sites in the park and probably many more yet to be discovered. The Darug people have a strong and ongoing cultural association with their traditional lands and waters. They, along with the Wiradjuri, Windradyne, Wanaruah and Darkinjung Local Aboriginal Land Councils and other Aboriginal groups, continue to be involved with Wollemi National Park today.</p>\n<p><b>Geological marvels</b><br>\nWollemi’s landscape has been sculpted over millennia into a magnificent network of soaring sandstone escarpments, plunging gorges and canyons, winding river valleys and awe-inspiring geological and geomorphological features such as pagoda rock formations, basalt-capped mountains and diatremes. The spectacular Colo gorge and its tributaries form the most extensive sandstone canyon system in eastern Australia. Grab your camera and discover for yourself the breathtaking vistas and natural marvels that make this a World Heritage treasure.</p>\n<p><b>Nature’s haven</b><br>\nIt’s little surprise that Wollemi’s spectacular landscape shelters a rich diversity of plants and animals. The rare Wollemi pine – a ‘living fossil’ whose closest relatives thrived some 90 million years ago – was rediscovered here in 1994, and the park protects an incredible array of botanical species and communities, from open eucalypt forest and woodlands including Hawkesbury and grey box, to rainforests and perched swamps. This variety makes it an appealing habitat for eastern grey kangaroos, red-necked wallabies and the elusive brush-tailed rock wallaby, as well as the beautifully marked broad-headed snake, regent honeyeater and glossy black cockatoo. Around 55 species of butterfly have also been recorded.</p>\n<p><b>Outdoor adventure</b><br>\nPitch a tent at one of Wollemi’s great campgrounds, like the secluded Colo Meroo backpack campground, the car-accessible Coorongooba campground or the dramatically-situated, car-accessible Newnes campground. With your base set up, you’re free to get out and enjoy the park’s fantastic outdoor attractions, be they more relaxed pursuits such as picnicking, canoeing and swimming or something more adventurous like rock climbing, horseriding and hiking.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001006","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Mudgee</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6370 9000<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 27 Inglis Street, Mudgee NSW 2850<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-4:00pm, Monday-Thursday</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001015","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Bulga</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6574 5555<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 2156 Putty Road, Bulga NSW 2330<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:30am-4:00pm, Tuesday-Thursday only</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001004","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Blue Mountains (Blackheath)</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 4787 8877<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au\">bluemountains.heritagecentre@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Govetts Leap Road, Blackheath NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9am - 4.30pm, seven days (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "},{"contact":"20071105000001077","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Richmond</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4588 2400<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> Bowmans Cottage, 370 Windsor Street, Richmond NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8.30am - 4.30pm, Monday to Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Wollemi National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>South Windsor (30km)</li>\n<li>Newcastle (100km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (100km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>To get to Ganguddy (Dunns swamp):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Narrango Road from Rylstone and drive for around 20km<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To reach Newnes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off Castlereagh Highway at Lidsdale, 7km west of Lithgow</li>\n<li>Newnes is 35km from the turnoff<br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get to Deep Pass: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn off Bells Line of Road at the Zig Zag railway and follow the gravel road for 7km</li>\n<li>Turn right at Newnes Forest Road and continue driving through the pine forest to its end - around 11.5km</li>\n<li>Turn right here on to Eastern Boundary Road, and then take the second road on the left to head towards Deep Pass North</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Wollemi National Park.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Sacred summit<br></b>Captain Cook named it Mount Warning, but to the Aboriginal community, it’s a sacred place known as Wollumbin. Many stories from communities in the far-reaching surrounding area are associated with this site. For local Aboriginal People, including Nganduwal, Galibal, Gidhabul and Widjabal, Wollumbin is an integral part of a complex network of mythological and significant sites interrelated and bound together by their Dreaming. Despite being dispossessed during early European settlement, local Aboriginal People maintain a diversity of living cultures and a unique and deep attachment to this land.</p>\n<p><b>Green rooms of the world<br></b>Wollumbin National Park is a Gondwana Rainforest of Australia. Gondwana rainforests include the world’s most extensive areas of subtropical rainforest, large areas of warm temperate rainforest and nearly all Antarctic beech cool temperate rainforest. Luckily, you don’t have to go far to experience some of these environments, which are practically in your backyard.</p>\n<p><b>Voices of the forest<br></b>Can you hear the pouched frog? It’s a very quiet ‘eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh’. Did you know that the sound of the eastern whipbird is a duet? The first long note comes from the male and then the female joins in with her whip crack response. From the high canopy down to the forest floor live a huge variety of animals and birds to see and hear. Though some, like the carpet python, land mullet, eastern small-eyed snake, lace monitor, black-bellied marsh snake and long-nosed potoroo, are very quiet creatures.</p>\n<p><b>Extreme plantlife<br></b>Plant species in Wollumbin seem varied to the extremes. There are prettily-named ones such as maidenhair, silkpod, watervine, wait-a-while, tree fern, wilkiea and red apple. These live alongside Wollunbin zieria, with its warty and felted branchlets, the prickly shield fern, stinging nettle, flooded gum, giant spear lily, dogwood, turpentine and, most disconcerting, giant stinging tree.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001043","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tweed Area Office</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6670 8600<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 1/135 Main St Murwillumbah NSW 2484<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Wollumbin National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul class=\"noindent\">\n<li>Murwillumbah (12km)</li>\n<li>Byron Bay (62km)</li>\n<li>Lismore (96km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Murwillumbah:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Head southwest towards Uki along Riverview Street, which becomes Kyogle Road, and then Uki Road at Byangum Bridge.</li>\n<li>Approximately 12km from Murwillumbah, before you reach Uki, turn right into Mount Warning Road.</li>\n<li>Travel approximately 3.5km to carpark</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Wollumbin National Park.

The Dreamtime myth of Gurrangatch relates to the forming of Wombeyan and Jenolan Caves. The caves are said to have been formed during a contest between Gurangatch, a mythical being that was part fish and part reptile, and Mirragan, a legendary tiger cat.</p>\n<p><b>On show</b><br>\nThe limestone caves of Wombeyan Karst Conservation Reserve are between 400 and 430 million years old. The geological processes that have created the magnificent cave system you see today continue to work their magic; you’ll notice the impressive cave decorations including stalactites and stalagmites that are created by the infiltration of water into the caves. Take a guided Discovery tour to find out more about the history and geology of the caves.</p>\n<p><b>Life in the air<br></b>Wombeyan Karst Conservation Reserve plays a special role in the conservation of some of Australia’s precious native flora and fauna. The moist forest that surrounds the park’s creeks are home to superb lyrebirds, the eastern whipbirds and flycatchers; look for lyrebird scratches around on the forest floor. Keep your eyes in the sky around the park’s rocky outcrops for birds of prey, including brown goshawks and wedge tailed eagles. You’ll have to look particularly carefully to see a tawny frogmouth; their camouflage is excellent – staying very still and upright – you might mistake them as part of the branch.</p>\n<p> </p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Adventure sports","id":"{F0580B11-F4A6-4C3A-9B10-9DCF6D1F82E5}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Cafes and kiosks","id":"{4DB1A4EC-B159-4538-89BC-3EE3DBF703D4}"},{"name":"Show caves","id":"{C58C2DB9-8AC5-475D-84AD-4CB9F6B411DD}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001283","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Wombeyan Caves</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 4843 5976<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Wombeyan.Caves@environment.nsw.gov.au\">Wombeyan.Caves@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00-4:30pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Wombeyan Karst Conservation Reserve is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mittagong (65km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (130km)</li>\n<li>Canberra (160km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (180km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the South Western Motorway to Casula, then take the left fork onto the Hume Highway</li>\n<li>After about 65km take the ramp to the Old Hume Highway at Aylmerton</li>\n<li>Turn right into Wombeyan Caves Road at Woodlands and continue driving for about 60km until you reach the reserve</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Canberra:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Federal Highway to Goulburn, then take Gouldburn-Taralga-Oberon Road towards Taralga for about 45km</li>\n<li>Turn right into Wombeyan Caves Road and continue driving for about 15km until you reach the reserve</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Wollongong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Mount Keira Road to Picton Road, then take the Old Hume Highway for about 35km</li>\n<li>Turn left into Wombeyan Caves Road and continue driving for about 60km until you reach the reserve</li>\n<li>Please note that the road from Mittagong to the cave is not suitable for caravans.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Slice of history<br></b>Talk about an interesting past - Woomargama has just that. In 1924, explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell set off from Sydney to see if there was an overland route to Melbourne. While you’re there, you’ll appreciate how difficult their hiking must've been. Hume and Hovell walking track, a 440km bushwalking trail from Yass to Albury, almost directly follows their footsteps. Before it was named a national park, parts of Woomargama were mined for tin and used as grazing land.</p>\n<p><b>Outstanding attractions<br></b>This wild landscape offers activities for all. Pitch a tent at one of the two campgrounds and use it as a base for exploring the surrounds. Pull on your hiking boots and hit the many trails that cross the park. They also offer a great ride if you fancy testing your limits on a mountain bike. It doesn’t have to be quite so full-on though. There are many beautiful wildflowers and animals that are best observed quietly, and photographers will love the view from Norths lookout.</p>\n<p><b>Wild things<br></b>Some of the more common animals you’ll see are echidnas, wombats, gliders, kangaroos and wallabies. These natives are best spotted in the early morning or late afternoon when they’re most active. There are rare creatures too: listen for the ‘ark’ calls of the brown toadlet which lives in burrows or under rocks. Look upwards to catch a flash of colour as a bright green superb parrot flies overhead.</p>\n<p><b>Tall timber<br></b>Situated in the transition zone between the mountainous NSW south-west slopes and the broad plains of the Riverina district, Woomargama has a vast range of forest and woodland communities. It contains the largest remnant community of box woodlands on the south-west slopes and is also home to the rare phantom wattle, which flowers golden yellow in spring.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001064","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Tumut</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> (02) 6947 7025<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:tumutrvc@environment.nsw.gov.au\">tumutrvc@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> The Old Butter Factory, Adelong Road, Tumut<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9:00am-5:00pm, daily (closed Christmas Day)</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Woomargama National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Holbrook (20km)</li>\n<li>Albury (30km)</li>\n<li>Tumbarumba (36km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Albury:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel north on Hume Highway</li>\n<li>Take the Woomargama exit</li>\n<li>Turn right into Tunnel Road and travel about 10km to the park’s boundary</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>For information about public transport options, visit the <a title=\"NSW country transport info website\" href=\"http://www.countrytransport.131500.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">NSW country transport info website</a>.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Woomargama National Park.

There are an extraordinary number of Aboriginal cultural sites that pre-date European settlement, scattered throughout the dunes. These include middens, campsites and burials, all of which reflect the cultural use of the land and have special cultural significance to the Worimi people.</p>\n<p><b>Dynamic dunes</b><br>\nSet your sights on the southern hemisphere’s largest mobile sand dune system at Stockton Bight. The landscape’s creation began well over 100,000 years ago, and believe it or not, these enormous dunes are ‘alive’ and forever changing. Stockton itself at 32km is the state’s longest beach, and its dunes offer endless appeal. Their shape, slope and stability vary with the weather. This unpredictability, potential for damage to Aboriginal cultural sites, and possible impacts to plants and animals are important reasons why we ask you not to drive over the dunes.</p>\n<p><b>Historic attractions</b><br>\nThere’s a lot more to this park than first meets the eye. The well-known MV <i>Sygna</i> shipwreck, lying south of the Lavis Lane entrance, is a fascinating site to visit and capture in a photograph.  Another interesting historic attraction are the Tin City huts, located around 10km from the top end of the beach. Once make-shift housing for Depression-era squatters, these shacks are an artefact of a bygone era.   </p>\n<p><b>Beach activities</b><br>\nSurfing, fishing, whale watching, birdwatching, dog walking, beach walking – the list continues.

Look closely at the trees in the floodplain where you're visiting – many bear the bark-stripping scars from canoe-making. Today, local Aboriginal people remain connected with Yanga National Park through employment or community involvement.</p>\n<p><b>A pioneering history</b><br>\nSome of the country’s renowned early explorers passed through this area, and you have the opportunity to retrace their steps. Explorers included John Oxley in 1817, Charles Sturt in 1830, Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836 and Burke and Wills in 1860. Visit nearby Balranald to see where Bourke and Wills’ party crossed the Murrumbidgee by the Mayall Street punt, then camped by the river in front of Balranald Inn.</p>\n<p><b>Unbeatable for birdwatchers</b><br>\nA large number of migratory birds rely on the park’s red gum wetlands. The park is a great place to see egrets, herons, spoonbills and glossy ibis using the wetlands as a resting, foraging and breeding ground. Walk to the bird hide at Yanga Lake  to see great crested grebes and sea eagles. The park is also home to the endangered southern bell frog. This frog's calls' are said to resemble a distant motorbike – listen carefully to see if you can hear it.</p>\n<p><b>A remarkable landscape</b><br>\nYanga National Park is blessed with 170km of Murrumbidgee River frontage. The river is great for canoeing or swimming, and its banks provide excellent fishing and camping spots. On your visit, you’ll notice the landscape’s unique contrast of black and red country. Vegetation on its black soil floodplains comprises river red gum forest and swampland, while its red soil varies from grass to saltbush to woodlands.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Ngarigo territory<br></b>Welcome to Ngarigo territory. The level ground, natural clearings, spring water and forest food sources would have made Yanununbeyan an attractive area to the Ngarigo. There are recorded Aboriginal sites in Yanununbeyan, which include artefact scatters of grey and black chert and quartz. The Ngarigo spent much of their time on the tablelands, yet when temperatures dropped in winter, they would seek shelter at lower altitudes.</p>\n<p><b>Times of change<br></b>Explorers came to this area in the early 1820s with the purpose of opening up new grazing lands. By the decade’s end, European settlers, along with their sheep and cattle, occupied Yanununbeyan. Up until the 1930s, a horse and buggy trail ran along the rough alignment of Woolcara trail and was used as a wool route between Tinderry Station and Bungendore. Physical remains of European settlement in Yanununbeyan include fences, bridle trails and shepherd’s huts. On Woolcara trail near The Springs, look for hand-built road foundations.</p>\n<p><b>Healthy competition<br></b>Eucalyptus is the dominant plant in Yanununbeyan, and its varieties include stringybark, brittle gum, scribbly gum, peppermint gum, snow gum, ribbon gum, mountain gum, apple box, argyle apple and candlebark. These grow in various communities such as wet eucalypt forest, intermediate eucalypt forest, dry eucalypt forest and woodland, grassy woodland and riparian.</p>\n<p><b>On a wing and a pouch<br></b>Yanununbeyan is home to many animals and a diverse range of birds. Around dawn and dusk, you’re likely to see kangaroos, wombats and wallabies. At night, eastern false pipistrelle, powerful owls and squirrel gliders come out to play or hunt or be hunted.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"Horse riding","id":"{2DDE0141-33C5-4066-A05A-330754270806}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001027","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Queanbeyan (National Parks and Wildlife)</h3>\n    <p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6229 7166<br/><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:info@environment.nsw.gov.au\">info@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 11 Farrer Street, Queanbeyan NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<ul>\n<li>Captains Flat (5km)</li>\n<li>Bungendore (30km)</li>\n<li>Queanbeyan (30km)</li>\n<li>Wollongong (273km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From<b> Queanbeyan</b>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Travel east on Kings Highway</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Captains Flat Road and follow for approximately 20km</li>\n<li>Turn right onto Woolcara Lane</li>\n<li>Follow Woolcara Lane into Yanununbeyan</li>\n</ul>\n","public_transport":"\n<p>Yanununbeyan State Conservation Area is not accessible by public transport.</p>\n","bike":"\n<p>Check out the <a title=\"Bicycle information for NSW website\" href=\"http://www.bicycleinfo.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Bicycle information for NSW website</a> for more information.</p>","parking":""},"weather_and_climate":{"visting_through_the_seasons":"\n<p>There are lots of great things waiting for you in Yanununbeyan State Conservation Area.

The area south of Shaws Farm offers trails for varying technical abilities, including some fantastic single trail rides.

Today, Aboriginal stories and rock engravings connect us with the rich cultural heritage of this ancient land and its people.</p>\n<p><b>World Heritage wonders<br></b>Yengo National Park is one of the eight conservation areas that make up the massive Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. Covering one million hectares, it was included in the World Heritage list in December 2000 for its remarkable geographic, botanic and cultural values. There are more than 90 different eucalypt species found here – some 13 per cent of all eucalypt species in the world.<br><br></p>\n<p><b>Remote wilderness to discover</b><br>\nYengo offers a range of activities and options for all ages. Unsealed tracks through remote valleys provide opportunities to explore the park on mountain bike or by 4WD. For bushwalkers, there are many options to experience the rugged beauty of the park on foot, with both short walks and overnight walks. In the Big Yango precinct, there are even opportunities for horse-riding adventures.</p>\n<p><b>Amazing animal and birdlife<br></b>Yengo is home to a great diversity of wildlife, including around 50 species of mammals such as wombats, wallaroos, koalas and gliding possums, and over 200 species of birds. Watch out for the gang gang, yellow-tailed and glossy black cockatoos gliding between the treetops, or see if you can spot a lyrebird darting across bush tracks.

Here are just some of the reasons why:</p>\n<p><b>Step back to a former mining era<br></b>Yerranderie township has retained much evidence of its history as a mining settlement of the early 20th century through its various remains, sites, mines, architecture and ruins. These, in combination with remnant exotic plantings, road systems and subdivision patterns, bring its early settlement to life for visitors.</p>\n<p><b>Archaeological significance<br></b>Yerranderie appears to be the only 20th century mining site to be preserved quasi-intact in all of eastern NSW and is an exceptionally well-preserved archaeological site. The township has been lovingly preserved to reflect its history, but the land itself has not seen much subsequent development due to its isolation. An unusually rich assemblage of mining equipment can still be viewed in the mines, and the township has a varied selection of sites, remains, ruins and buildings.</p>\n<p><b>Dramatic natural environment<br></b>Yerranderie lies at the centre of a broad visual catchment surrounded by sandstone escarpments and indigenous bushland. The combination of this spectacular natural setting, strong sense of isolation, and the remnants of mining and settlement activity of the past all contribute to give the township a powerful identity and sense of place.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Cycling","id":"{5919415E-0614-45D4-996E-391819CCEEA5}"},{"name":"4WD touring","id":"{79B7BD90-D6AD-4786-B02B-C76307413B18}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001005","contact_details_full":"\n        <h3>Oberon</h3>\n\t<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6336 1972<br/><strong>Street address:</strong> 38 Ross Street, Oberon NSW<br/><strong>Opening hours:</strong> 9.00am - 4.30pm, Monday to Friday</p>\n        "}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Yerranderie Regional Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oberon (90km)</li>\n<li>Sydney (320km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Sydney:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take the Great Western Highway or Bell's Line of Road then turn south at Hartley onto Jenolan Caves Road.

Generations of Yaegl and Gumbaynggirr people camped, fished and held ceremonies here and numerous areas remain of strong spiritual significance to the Aboriginal community. Take the Freshwater Walk and view the park’s most impressive pandanus palms – this important Gumbaynggirr ceremonial plant was used to weave neckbands, dillybags and baskets.</p>\n<p><b>A watery wonderland</b><br>\nThe park not only boasts a superb coastline but also features rivers, lakes and estuaries, so swimmers and snorkelers are spoilt for choice. Remember your fishing rod – the waters off the park are excellent for jewfish and groper, and Sandon River is among the state’s most popular fishing spots. If surfing is your thing, you can’t beat the legendary Angourie Surfing Reserve – it hosts what’s arguably Australia’s best right-hand point break. Yuraygir is also a paddler’s paradise, its sheltered waterways provide the ideal setting for canoeing, kayaking and boating.</p>\n<p><b>Important landscapes</b><br>\nWhen you visit Yuraygir, you’re entering one of the most diverse bioregions in Australia. Wander past age-old coastal landforms, littoral rainforest, eucalypt forest, woodland and wetlands – much of which simply wouldn’t be there without the park’s protection. Pay a visit to Shelley Headland to see the state’s most significant remaining example of grassy clay heath.</p>\n<p><b>Precious and protected</b><br>\nAt Yuraygir, you can see some of the country’s most vulnerable native wildlife up close, such as squirrel gliders and eastern grass owls. See if you can spot the unusual rufous bettong, a rarely-seen rabbit-sized marsupial also known as the rufous rat-kangaroo. Or even the shy Queensland blossom-bat, Australia’s smallest fruit bat. Keep an eye out for coastal emus – once so prevalent; they’re sadly now endangered with fewer than 100 left in the park.</p>"},"see_and_do":{"see_do_interest_categories":[{"name":"Aboriginal heritage","id":"{3818562E-77C6-4D62-A56E-B457510F74AF}"},{"name":"History","id":"{D85578D8-E045-4F12-ACC0-54391A61627B}"},{"name":"Car touring","id":"{2C6BC550-BBDA-46FC-B647-1FBD4DB0F371}"},{"name":"Lookouts and scenic views","id":"{7741C57D-86F4-484C-95BC-723F90C4454A}"},{"name":"Picnics and barbecues","id":"{00719DD4-CCAC-4106-B392-2D028530D7F5}"},{"name":"Canoeing/paddling","id":"{9D60B6DE-159E-49B8-910D-94989F67D26E}"},{"name":"Fishing","id":"{7F4BCA13-F242-4588-9C1F-8156FCD5255B}"},{"name":"Sailing and boating","id":"{46A5634B-35B6-4246-9F35-BB6D4558D2CB}"},{"name":"Snorkelling and scuba","id":"{E5C1DA6B-7584-4133-851C-D2008DBCA5A6}"},{"name":"Surfing","id":"{43107B98-0940-4DC1-AEBF-0807B9E6E9B2}"},{"name":"Swimming","id":"{B0DB8284-9691-4CBA-ADE0-82D357A0B94E}"},{"name":"Wheelchair facilities","id":"{95A79169-DF49-4F7F-A0DA-EFF2E78EA9A3}"},{"name":"Whale watching","id":"{72F41C54-2547-4547-9148-8F1DC268CF47}"}]},"contacts":[{"contact":"20071105000001038","contact_details_full":"<h3>Grafton</h3>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong> 02 6641 1500<br />\n<strong>Fax:</strong> 02 6641 1599<br />\n<strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au\">ClarenceSouth.Area@environment.nsw.gov.au</a><br />\n<strong>Street address:</strong> Level 4, 49 Victoria Street, Grafton NSW<br />\n<strong>Postal address:</strong> PO Box 361, Grafton NSW 2460<br />\n<strong>Opening hours:</strong> 8:30am-4:30pm, Monday-Friday</p>"}],"getting_there":{"close_to":"\n<p>Yuraygir National Park is close to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yamba (6km)</li>\n<li>Maclean (20km)</li>\n<li>Grafton (39km)</li>\n<li>Coffs Harbour (42km)</li>\n</ul>\n","car":"\n<p>From Grafton:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drive south on the Pacific Highway for 10km, then take the Wooli and Minnie Water turnoff.</li>\n<li>Continue for 25km then, at the T-intersection, turn left to Minnie Water to get to Illaroo camping area, or right to Wooli.</li>\n<li>From Wooli Road, turn left onto Diggers Camp Road to get to the Boorkoom camping area and Wilsons Headland picnic area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Maclean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take Brooms Head Road through Gulmarrad</li>\n<li>After 19km, turn left to reach the campgrounds at Lake Arragan, Red Cliff and Grey Cliff</li>\n<li>Turn right off Brooms Head Road and travel along the Sandon Road for 9km to get to the Sandon River camping area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Coffs Harbour:</p>\n<p>From Coffs Harbour, travel north on the Pacific Highway for 49km, then turn right onto McPhillips Road.
